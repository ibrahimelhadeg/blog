<h1 id="The-Scope-and-Limits-of-Security-Analysis"><a href="#The-Scope-and-Limits-of-Security-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="The Scope and Limits of Security Analysis"></a>The Scope and Limits of Security Analysis</h1><p>Graham starts the first chapter off with the definition of analysis, and defines it as “the careful study of available facts with the attempt to draw conclusions therefrom based on established principles and sound logic.”  He then goes into the three parts of analysis, which include:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Descriptive Function - </strong>gaining all the important facts and information, and putting it together in a coherent manner in order to conduct analysis on them</li>
<li><strong>Selective Function - </strong>how you decide whether or not to buy/sell a security (linked to the idea of intrinsic value)</li>
<li><strong>Critical Function - </strong>above all, it is critical that the analyst is able to combine correct facts (taking into consideration accounting policies), and synthesize these facts into sound judgments to come to a decision.  As an inexperienced investor myself, this final function sounds like it is a product of many years of practice, which may explain why Graham only spends a short paragraph introducing it in the first chapter.</li>
</ol>
<p>This first chapter mainly covers the selective function, specifically introducing the following ideas:</p>
<h2 id="Intrinsic-Value"><a href="#Intrinsic-Value" class="headerlink" title="Intrinsic Value"></a>Intrinsic Value</h2><p>As we all know, the basis behind Graham and Dodd’s Security analysis is the concept of “intrinsic value.”  Right off the bat, Graham explains that this term is largely ambiguous, and cannot be explicitly defined.  Contrary to previous valuations of companies that deemed their “worth” as their book value or earnings power (EPS), intrinsic value is a much more complicated issue. Additionally, near the end of the chapter, he layers on the fact that intrinsic value is largely ineffective when conducting an analysis on speculative securities; namely young or volatile companies that do not have a stable track record/earnings.  He therefore recommends that any analysis of intrinsic value should be done on stable companies for best results. I particularly liked the simile that Graham uses to describe intrinsic value when he says that “it is quite possible to decide by inspection that a woman is old enough to vote without knowing her age or that a man is heavier than he should be without knowing his exact weight.”  This is how we should view the concept of “intrinsic value,” and should never attempt to pin down an <em>exact number</em> by which we make our investment decisions on.</p>
<h2 id="Principle-Obstacles-to-the-Success-of-an-Analyst"><a href="#Principle-Obstacles-to-the-Success-of-an-Analyst" class="headerlink" title="Principle Obstacles to the Success of an Analyst"></a>Principle Obstacles to the Success of an Analyst</h2><p>After explaining his intrinsic value concept, Graham introduces three obstacles to the successful analysis of a security:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inadequacy or Incorrectness of data - </strong>After reforms and regulations over the many years that the market has operated, this is not an issue for most analysts.  The job of the analyst is to make sure that they understand the company’s accounting policies, and how these policies affect the financial statements therein.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainties of the future - </strong>This is the idea that stable companies are much easier to analyze with accurate conclusions than infant companies or companies in volatile industries.  Graham says: “Exactly the same mathematical advantage which practically assures good results in the investment field may prove entirely ineffective where luck is the overshadowing influence.”</li>
<li><strong>Irrational behavior of the market - </strong>The analyst operates under two assumptions, which say that first, the market price is frequently out of line with the intrinsic value, and secondly, securities have the inherent tendency to correct themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>On that last point, there is much stigma in the world of investments in regards to the EMH.  Throughout my education as a Finance major, I have heard it preached many a times, and must go on a limb to say that I believe Graham is correct in saying that there <em>are</em> discrepancies in price-intrinsic value that value investors are capable of finding.  Although I have yet to read Burt Malkiel’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2eicZcx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Random Walk Down Wall Street</a>, after reading <a href="http://www.zachgollwitzer.net/book-reviews/the-snowball-warren-buffett-and-the-business-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warren Buffett’s biography</a>, I shamelessly (for now) believe that there is room for value investors in the investing world. The EMH does make sense in theory, but investor sentiment and irrationality lend to inaccurate prices.  Graham’s explanation of how the market is a “voting machine” in the short term resonated with me, because he explains market price as the combination of <em>market factors, FV factors, intrinsic value factors</em>, as well as the <em>individual choices</em> of market participants. This lends particularly well to Ray Dalio’s explanation of our economy, whereby he explains that the economy is comprised of millions of <em>transactions</em>, each of which are the result of _human choices.  _I find it hard to believe after reading <a href="http://www.economicprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/ray_dalio__how_the_economic_machine_works__leveragings_and_deleveragings.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dalio’s “How the Economic Machine Works”</a> along with Daniel Kahneman’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2dSTjL0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking Fast and Slow</a> that the market is completely efficient. That said, my experience as an investor is comparable to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7ay9YX6KKE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Jordan’s experience as an actor,</a> and therefore my convictions are loosely held at this point.Fundamental Elements in the Problem of Analysis: Quantitative and Qualitative Factors<br>In the second chapter of security analysis, Graham makes it a point to distinguish between what types of data are qualitative/quantitative, the relative weightings we should give to each type, and the four underlying factors that an analyst must consider when purchasing, selling, or holding a security. The beginning of this chapter names the four factors that influence the buy/sell/hold decision:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Security</strong> - An analyst must assess the character of the enterprise and the terms of the commitment.<ul>
<li>Graham believed that it is usually a better option to buy from a high-grade enterprise with unfavorable terms of commitment than from a low-grade enterprise with favorable terms of commitment.  He also notes that the untrained investor should follow this rule more-so than the trained investor (who may be able to generate stable returns from a low-grade enterprise through careful analysis).</li>
<li>When looking at the terms, it is important to ask yourself whether you could find something less risky with the same or better return.  For example, if the company offers a preferred share that is junior to other debt, and is non-cumulative, then regardless of the return, it is at risk of not being covered, and should be avoided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Price - </strong>Although not as important for fixed income investments, price should always be considered, especially when dealing with common stock.</li>
<li><strong>The Time</strong> - Buying a security in one year may be a smart decision, while a terrible one the next.  Simply copying Warren Buffett’s portfolio will never work because his returns are largely  based on the <em>time</em> in which he bought the securities.</li>
<li><strong>The Person</strong> - What is your risk tolerance?  How old are you?  How much disposable income do you have?  What is your level of intelligence in regards to investing?</li>
</ol>
<p>After discussing these four factors, Graham moves on to discussing the various quantitative and qualitative factors in analysis.  Throughout, it is clear that he favors the quantitative analysis, and often regards what most would consider “qualitative” as quantitative.</p>
<h2 id="Quantitative-vs-Qualitative-Analysis"><a href="#Quantitative-vs-Qualitative-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Quantitative vs. Qualitative Analysis"></a>Quantitative vs. Qualitative Analysis</h2><h3 id="How-detailed-should-your-analysis-be"><a href="#How-detailed-should-your-analysis-be" class="headerlink" title="How detailed should your analysis be?"></a>How detailed should your analysis be?</h3><p>Graham notes that an analysis should be carried out to the extent of money being put down on the investment, and the type of investment. With many investments, the research process is never-ending, and therefore the analyst must have clear intentions and goals for what he/she wants to find out, and only consider the most important factors.((And this was written back during a time where the internet was not available to nearly everyone in the world!  If Graham is warning against over-analyzing back then, I can only presume that filtering out the non-important details is much harder in today’s world.)) These “important” factors are largely dependent on the type of business being analyzed. For example, Graham states that the 5 year net earnings of a large railroad enterprise is going to weigh much more on an analysis than the 5 year net earnings of a small, volatile oil company.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-quantitative-analysis"><a href="#What-is-quantitative-analysis" class="headerlink" title="What is quantitative analysis?"></a>What is quantitative analysis?</h3><p>Graham states that quantitative analysis is all of the useful items in the income statement and balance sheet, particularly <em>capitalization, earnings and dividends, assets/liabilities, and operating statistics</em>. Although Graham saves the details of quantitative analysis for later chapters, he does state that “broadly speaking, the quantitative factors lend themselves far better to thoroughgoing analysis than do the qualitative factors.”</p>
<h3 id="What-is-qualitative-analysis"><a href="#What-is-qualitative-analysis" class="headerlink" title="What is qualitative analysis?"></a>What is qualitative analysis?</h3><p>Graham spends much more time explaining the nuances of qualitative analysis, because in his opinion, it is largely over-weighted in many analyses, and misunderstood by many analysts. He states that qualitative factors could include the nature of the business, position of the company in their industry, physical/geographical/operating characteristics, management quality, and the outlook for the business in the future. All of these are important, but Graham believes that there are two that should be scrutinized in greater detail than the rest: <strong>The Factor of Management</strong> Graham notes that valuing management strength is far from scientific, and an analyst must avoid putting too much weight in this factor. Many analysts make the mistake of valuing the management factor <em>twice</em> in calculations (once based on profits/quantitative data, and once based on subjective judgments of managerial ability). <strong>Nature of the Business and its Future Prospects</strong> Graham speaks a lot about trends, and how these trends are often taken too literally as “quantitative” by nature. All businesses and industries go in cycles, and therefore a strong business with 10 years of consistent earnings does not necessarily ensure that these earnings will continue. Therefore, Graham states that “the analyst must take possible future changes into account, but his primary aim is not so much to <em>profit</em> from them as to <em>guard against</em> them.” I find this particular point quite interesting thanks to a class I took as an undergrad that taught methods of projecting future free cash flows, and valuing the business in what Graham would consider a “qualitative” manner. As found <a href="http://www.zachgollwitzer.net/my-coursework-undergrad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here under my projects</a>, you can see that our buy/sell/hold decision was entirely based on past results and projected outcomes. I find it disturbing that during the entirety of that semester, not once did the professor explain <em>why</em> we were doing what we were doing, nor did he explain <em>where</em> a projection of future earnings fit into a comprehensive analysis of a security. Anyways, Graham was adamant over the fact that “trends” and “projections” are useful in the analysis, but are more often than not over-weighted. Lastly, Graham concludes that what an analyst must look for in a business is not necessarily impressive future projections, but rather <em>inherent stability</em>.  Sure, a motor company may have an average pref. dividend coverage ratio of 25 over the last ten years, while a grocery chain only averages a ratio of 5, but in terms of <em>inherent stability</em>, a smart analyst would favor the grocery chain, mainly because he/she knows that this type of business is going to be stable through any economic condition, while motor company may not.  Sources of Information in Investing<br>A short chapter by nature, Graham discusses the various sources of information for conducting an analysis.  Since the book was written back in the 1930s, obviously many of the sources are outdated, and many of the SEC regulations have changed.  For example, Graham spends a good amount of time criticizing the fact that companies did not publish quarterly results, which are now commonplace for publicly traded companies. Although the individual sources of information are outdated, Graham presents us with the basics of obtaining information on a company.  He states that as an analyst, we are looking for information on the following three items:</p>
<ol>
<li>Terms of the Specific Issue</li>
<li>The Company</li>
<li>The Industry</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Terms-of-the-Specific-Issue"><a href="#Terms-of-the-Specific-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Terms of the Specific Issue"></a>Terms of the Specific Issue</h1><p>An analyst should look for information on the terms of a bond in the “deed of trust,” or the “indenture.” For stocks, he/she should consult the “articles of incorporation,” or “charter.”</p>
<h1 id="The-Company"><a href="#The-Company" class="headerlink" title="The Company"></a>The Company</h1><p>There are many places to obtain information on the company itself. As most know, companies are required to file a 10-K (contained in the annual report), 10-Q (each quarter), and 8-K (for material events). Graham then dives into miscellaneous sources of information including periodic reports to public agencies (mainly utility companies), listing applications, miscellaneous official reports, statistical and financial publications (The Economist, Moodys, etc.), and finally, information directly from the company. I particularly found Graham’s point about obtaining direct information from the company interesting, because as an analyst, it would be quite easy to overlook. Graham states: “It must never be forgotten that a stockholder is an <em>owner</em> of the business and an <em>employer</em> of its officers… The courts have generally held that a bona fide stockholder has the same right to full information as a partner in a private business.”</p>
<h1 id="The-Industry"><a href="#The-Industry" class="headerlink" title="The Industry"></a>The Industry</h1><p>Graham does not spend much time explaining this source of information, but says that the most reliable information on the industry will come from the United States Department of Commerce. Distinctions between Investment and Speculation<br>A cornerstone chapter to the entire book, Graham discusses his opinion on the fundamental differences between “speculation” and “investment.” He begins by introducing the reader to commonly held beliefs about the topic, and discusses five distinctions that we must make when considering whether an investment is speculative:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bonds vs. Stocks - </strong>Many would say that bonds are investments, while stocks are speculative, which Graham proves wrong by noticing how some low grade bonds don’t always promise repayment of principle, while some high grade preferred stocks are largely safe “investments.”</li>
<li><strong>Outright Purchases vs. Purchases on Margin - </strong>Although usually buying outright is a safer method of acquisition and considered “investment practice,” there are scenarios where the opposite is true.((Graham mentions an example of penny mining stocks that in the past had to be bought outright, yet represented highly speculative prospects))</li>
<li><strong>For Permanent Holding vs. for a Quick Turn - </strong>Generally, permanent holding is considered the investment approach, but yet again, Graham offers an example where this is false.</li>
<li><strong>For Income vs. for Profit - </strong>Graham mentions that there are fine lines on with this distinction, because he doesn’t want to convey that “investment” ignores the prospect of security appreciation.  Sure, many speculators put down money with the intention of future appreciation, which independently denotes a speculation, but at the same time, it is unfair to say that true investors are not looking for capital appreciation along with dividend stability as well.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Securities vs. Risky Issues - </strong>Graham states: “The concept of safety can be really useful only if it based on something more tangible than the psychology of the purchaser.”  Although he does not explicitly state what that “more tangible” component is, the reader can infer the general idea here.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="What-is-an-“Investment-”"><a href="#What-is-an-“Investment-”" class="headerlink" title="What is an “Investment?”"></a>What is an “Investment?”</h1><p>After covering these distinctions, Graham offers his definition of an “investment:”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return.  Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An investment operation is one that can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From these definitions, we can conclude that the goal of investing from Graham’s perspective is largely to analyze with great scrutiny, protect principal, and <em>then</em> worry about maximizing return (while avoiding greed).  Unlike many investors, Graham was under the impression that the future was to be protected against rather than profited from. Back in 2008, we saw a collective disobedience to this rule, as many homebuyers were speculating (according to Graham) on the appreciation of home values.  All was good until these home values tanked, whereby principal value was lost!</p>
<h1 id="Types-of-Investment-and-Speculation"><a href="#Types-of-Investment-and-Speculation" class="headerlink" title="Types of Investment and Speculation"></a>Types of Investment and Speculation</h1><p>According to Graham, there are four types of investments, all of which are not mutually exclusive.  He states that ideally, all purchases should fall at least under the “analyst’s investment” category:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Business Investment</strong> - money put/held in a business</li>
<li><strong>Financial Investment</strong> - securities in general</li>
<li><strong>Sheltered Investment</strong> - small risk</li>
<li><strong>Analyst’s Investment</strong> - investments that upon thorough study promise safety of principal and adequate return</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, there are two types of speculation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intelligent Speculation </strong>- Risk that appears justified after careful analysis and weighing the pros and cons ((As a young investor starting out with little capital to lose, many opportunities that might be “unintelligent speculation” for someone with more capital could be “intelligent speculation” for myself.  For example, my investment in Bitcoin could be seen as largely speculative, yet with the little amount of capital I have put down, and the large upside, I reason that this could fall under “intelligent speculation.”))</li>
<li><strong>Unintelligent Speculation </strong>- Risk taking without adequate study of the situation (buying a stock because you heard it was going to increase in value)</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, Graham argues that an investor must consider price in his/her decision, because ignoring it is largely speculative.  Specifically, he mentions how many “experts” would claim General Electric (GE) to be an “investment” irrespective of the price at the time.  Graham believes that this is false, and one should pay attention to price; splitting it up into investment and speculative pieces.  In the GE example, Graham states that at the going price of $38/share, the investment is speculative, while at $25/share it is not (based on intrinsic value calculations).  This means that if someone were to purchase shares at $38/share, then $25 of each share is an investment, while $13 of each share is speculative, and largely based on future prospects as well as the reputation of GE.  Graham recommends that an analyst use the concept of intrinsic value to categorize various price points of each prospective purchase.Classification of Securities<br>In this final chapter of Part 1, Graham introduces the investor to his classification system of investments.  While nowadays, derivatives, options, futures, convertibles, etc. all introduce thousands of possibilities, Graham’s classification system still shows significance today.   As with his stance on “investments” vs. “speculations,” Graham classifies investments less on title, and more on the risk that the security brings to the investor.  With this loss averse approach, we see that many of the “safe” securities are not quite as safe as once thought.</p>
<h1 id="Objections-to-the-Conventional-Grouping"><a href="#Objections-to-the-Conventional-Grouping" class="headerlink" title="Objections to the Conventional Grouping"></a>Objections to the Conventional Grouping</h1><p>Graham begins by dismissing three common beliefs about the classification of securities:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preferred stock should not be grouped with common stock</strong> - although most would think of these as related terms, Graham believes that based on the structure of the investment, preferred stock belongs more with the category of bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Not all bonds are safe investments</strong> - Although bonds have been associated with low returns and safety as a result of sacrificing returns, this is not always true.  If a bond issuer is not financially stable to guarantee the principle, then this investment is not safe!</li>
<li><strong>The common classification of bonds, preferred stock, and common stock are poor ways of describing classes of securities, because there are so many deviations from each </strong>-  Sure, a bond might be described as a security that guarantees interest and principle at a maturity date, but what about convertibles?  How about income bonds?  The deviations are endless.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="New-Classification-of-Securities"><a href="#New-Classification-of-Securities" class="headerlink" title="New Classification of Securities"></a>New Classification of Securities</h1><p>Since Graham does not believe that the common way of classifying securities is adequate, he offers his own. This system is divided into three classes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Securities of the fixed value type (high-grade bond, preferred stock)</li>
<li>Senior Securities of the variable value type (speculative bonds and preferred stocks)<ul>
<li>Well-protected issues with profit possibilities (convertibles)</li>
<li>Inadequately protected issues (low-grade senior issues)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Common-Stock Type</li>
</ol>
<p>He then states that these three categories are not absolutes, and various securities are based on _specific terms and the status to the owner.  _For example, an investment grade bond selling at a low price is going to fall under group 2, because it has a chance for enormous appreciation of principle.  The line that we draw between the three categories is a fine one, and largely dependent on the opinion of the individual classifying them. I think the point Graham was trying to get across during this chapter was not so much the idea of classifying securities for the sake of classifying, but more-so to get the investor thinking practically rather than mindlessly.  It is quite easy to look at a bond from a reputable bank and feel safe investing your money in it, but Graham challenges the investor to question the creditworthiness of the bank before making the investment.  As we saw in 2008, not all banks are as reliable as we might have once thought. Instead of classifying investments based on title and opinion, we should evaluate them based on characteristics and facts.Theory of Common Stock Investment<br>In the first chapter of part 4 (Theory of Common Stock: The Dividend Factor), Graham takes several pages to explain the various merits of common stock analysis, and how we have come to the common method of earnings trends as a method for selecting common stock investments.  As a college student studying corporate finance, I found this chapter compelling, as I have been taught what Graham calls the “New-Era Theory” of common stock investment.  Either Graham has got it all wrong (quite a daring assumption given Warren Buffett’s track record), or I have been taught a fallible method to investment.((It is hard for me to have any sort of opinion at this point given my low level of experience and expertise))</p>
<h1 id="The-Underlying-Premise-of-Stock-Theory"><a href="#The-Underlying-Premise-of-Stock-Theory" class="headerlink" title="The Underlying Premise of Stock Theory"></a>The Underlying Premise of Stock Theory</h1><p>Graham begins the chapter by noting the significance of <em>what</em> stock you are analyzing, and how it affects the entire analysis. If an investor analyzes a random stock that does not show good financials, a competitive advantage, or other characteristics of a healthy business, then the ENTIRE ANALYSIS WILL YIELD INEFFECTIVE. I can only assume that this is why value investors are so keen on the use of stock screeners, which will return only those investments in which analysis is useful on.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-Common-Stock-Investment-become-so-Popular"><a href="#How-did-Common-Stock-Investment-become-so-Popular" class="headerlink" title="How did Common Stock Investment become so Popular?"></a>How did Common Stock Investment become so Popular?</h1><p>Graham states two primary reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Due to the large number of stocks which have shown substantial earnings and increase in value over the last century</li>
<li>Improved reporting (thanks to the SEC) that allows investors to actually analyze what they are buying</li>
</ol>
<p>Later in the chapter, he explains the herd mentality in the post WWI boom that resulted in even the most novice investors trying a hand at common stock investment, and with success! This artificial validation caused positive sentiment in regards to stock investing, and had a domino effect that caused security prices to increase over long periods of time. In addition (although Graham would have never been able to recognize), it seems that the internet has created a situation in which investors of all sorts have the ability to quickly and cheaply invest in any common stock they want, whenever they want.</p>
<h1 id="The-Pre-War-Method-of-Analyzing-Stocks"><a href="#The-Pre-War-Method-of-Analyzing-Stocks" class="headerlink" title="The Pre-War Method of Analyzing Stocks"></a>The Pre-War Method of Analyzing Stocks</h1><p>Graham goes on to discuss the pre-war method for analyzing a common stock, and argues that it is the <em>correct way</em> of analysis. The three components that pre-war analysts looked for in a stock were:</p>
<ol>
<li>The company pays a consistent dividend</li>
<li>Earnings are stable and are a significant margin above the dividend</li>
<li>Each dollar of market price was backed by tangible assets (BV is similar to price)</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, investing in common stock in the pre-war era was the same process as investing in a medium grade bond. Just like the bond-buyer would look for a stable business that had enough earnings to pay interest, the stock-buyer would look for a stable business with enough earnings power to cover their dividends. Additionally, pre-war stock investors would view the purchase of stock as buying part of a business. They would look at the <em>price</em> of the stock, and determine whether the earnings of the company was adequate to justify the premium/discount paid over/under the book value.</p>
<h1 id="The-New-Era-Method-of-Analyzing-Stocks"><a href="#The-New-Era-Method-of-Analyzing-Stocks" class="headerlink" title="The New-Era Method of Analyzing Stocks"></a>The New-Era Method of Analyzing Stocks</h1><p>After presenting his idea of the <em>correct</em> theory of stock investment, Graham dives into the history and pitfalls of our new-era theory of common stock investment. Unlike the pre-war era, post-war analysts based the value of a stock on its earnings trends and future projections of earnings, whilst disregarding the price entirely. He summarizes this investment philosophy is three components:</p>
<ol>
<li>The value of a common stock depends on what it can earn in the future</li>
<li>Good common stocks are those which have shown a rising trend in earnings</li>
<li>Good common stocks will prove sound and profitable investments</li>
</ol>
<p>He then makes it clear that the major fallacy in this new method is the fact that price is entirely ignored! In an example, he shows a chart of three companies from 1925-1929 (part of the new-era), and compares the price of each to their average EPS over those years:</p>
<div id="before-table"></div>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Average EPS (1925-1929)</th>
<th>1929 High</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Electric Power and Light</td>
<td>$1.98</td>
<td>$86.63</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bangor &amp; Aroostook R.R.</td>
<td>$7.71</td>
<td>$90.38</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chicago Yellow Cab</td>
<td>$4.94</td>
<td>$35.00</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Apparently, in 1929, the market valued Electric Power and Light more than twice as much as Yellow Cab despite the fact that Yellow Cab earned 2.5 times as much per share on average over the last five years. This, Graham states, is the danger of using future earnings projections and past earnings trends as your <em>primary</em> indicator of investment quality.Newer Canons of Common-Stock Investment<br>After completely destroying the new-era method of investing in common stock in the previous chapter, Graham utilizes this chapter to explain the proper methods of investing in stocks. Yes, using trends and future projections of earnings is a poor indicator to use as the <em>sole</em> reason for investing in a stock, but Graham explains that with careful analysis, this can supplement the research of a stock greatly. He then goes on to say that under three premises, common stock investment does in fact have some merit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Diversify your portfolio of stocks</li>
<li>Use quantitative AND qualitative analysis; similar to analysis you would do for fixed value investments</li>
<li>Make an even greater effort in your analysis for common stocks than fixed value investments, as they pose greater risk</li>
</ol>
<p>Under these premises, Graham states that there are three primary (and acceptable) approaches to common stock investment.</p>
<h1 id="Secular-Expansion-as-a-Basis"><a href="#Secular-Expansion-as-a-Basis" class="headerlink" title="Secular Expansion as a Basis"></a>Secular Expansion as a Basis</h1><p>Some investors who carry a high quality, diversified portfolio of common stocks plan on making a return based on the fact that the overall market will forever be increasing in value. This is under the assumption that our national GDP will forever increase, while at the same time, this increase in our economy’s wealth will spill over into stocks, which increase as a result of capital investment and re-investment of undistributed earnings. Based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ray Dalio’s view of the economy</a>, and historical data, I do believe that the overall economy will continue to increase over time, but it is hard for me to reason that an investor could consistently choose a portfolio of common stocks that reflect this growth.</p>
<h1 id="Individual-Growth-Basis-of-Selection"><a href="#Individual-Growth-Basis-of-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Individual Growth Basis of Selection"></a>Individual Growth Basis of Selection</h1><p>The next method that Graham points out as a possible way of investing is based around the idea that there are in fact “growth stocks” out there, which no matter what happens to the economy, through all the cycles, will increase over time. Graham is clearly not a proponent of this method. He states that even if there are growth companies out there, it would be awfully difficult for an investor to find them.  This is because every successful company has a <a href="http://www.justintimemanagement.com/en/The-7-stages-of-business-life-cycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well defined life cycle</a> ((Sure, there are exceptions, but based on many years of data, this seems to be the trend)), which means that picking a growth company early in its cycle is difficult (how do you know it isn’t just a lucky up-trend?), yet so is picking a growth company late in its cycle (it has to go down sometime!). Additionally, since it is difficult to tell at what stage a company is in, predicting future earnings and judging your “optimal price” based on these would be difficult. Lastly, Graham states that this method is only “investment quality” if the buyer does their due diligence in the research phase, and purchases the stock at a price in which a reasonable person would pay if they were purchasing the entire business and exercising full control over it.((Remember, when buying a stock, according to pre-war methods of investment, we are purchasing a chunk of the business!))</p>
<h1 id="Selection-Based-on-Margin-of-Safety"><a href="#Selection-Based-on-Margin-of-Safety" class="headerlink" title="Selection Based on Margin-of-Safety"></a>Selection Based on Margin-of-Safety</h1><p>This is quite apparently Graham’s (and Warren Buffett’s) favorite method for purchasing common stock. Under this method, an investor can either buy low and sell high, or purchase undervalued stocks that have gone under the radar during good economic times. Over the years, we have seen Warren Buffett employ both; perplexing those who think that the market is perfectly efficient. Under the first method of buying low and selling high, Graham actually offers a concrete method for selecting stocks. He says that one should take a basket of the strongest stocks in the market (S&amp;P 500, DOW, etc.), calculate an average EPS capitalized at the going long term interest rate, and then determine your personal buying and selling points above and below this average line.((If the market price of the index is below, then it is undervalued (buy signal); above, and it is overvalued(sell signal) )) Out of curiosity, I have conducted this recommended analysis on the S&amp;P 500 as of November 2, 2016:</p>
<div id="before-table"></div>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>30 Year Treasury Rate</td>
<td>2.55%</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Price of S&amp;P 500</td>
<td>2,100.08</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Based on this data, I calculated that the intrinsic value of the S&amp;P 500 based on the 30 year treasury rate was $912.94,((23.28*(1/.0255) )) which would indicate that the market is generally overvalued right now.  I don’t fully understand the components of such an analysis, but Graham states that there are three major drawbacks to this method:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sure, you can identify the general pattern of the market, but picking buy/sell price points is still difficult</li>
<li>There is always the chance that the market’s behavior may change significantly</li>
<li>By using this method, you are investing in the opposite direction of most other investors, which is often difficult to stomach.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second method of buying undervalued securities in good economic times is a bit tougher initially, but does not necessarily require the investor to bet against the market as does the first method above. Graham states that due to the many companies that have unusually good prospects of growth being overvalued in the market, you are going to inevitably find a few stocks that are in good financial condition (average growth prospects, well financed, expected to survive long into the future, important to their industry, etc.), yet due to a couple of poor earnings years, are undervalued. A value investor loves these types of purchases, although they are certainly harder to find than stocks trading low due to poor economic times.The Dividend Factor in Common Stock Analysis<br>This entire chapter is primarily about the debate over whether a company should retain earnings and reinvest in the business, or pay out earnings in the form of dividends.  Graham is clearly a proponent of a company paying out a majority of their earnings in dividends, and also a believer that the shareholders should be the ones who determine dividend policies rather than the upper management, who may have a conflict of interest due to the higher salaries they can make by retaining earnings. At the beginning, Graham states that a valuation of a common stock should be split into three factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>The dividend rate and record</li>
<li>Earning Power</li>
<li>Asset Value</li>
</ol>
<p>This chapter primarily focuses on dividends and earnings.</p>
<h1 id="Why-would-a-company-withhold-dividends"><a href="#Why-would-a-company-withhold-dividends" class="headerlink" title="Why would a company withhold dividends?"></a>Why would a company withhold dividends?</h1><p>Graham explains that there are three primary reasons that a board of directors would choose to withhold dividends:</p>
<ol>
<li>To strengthen the working capital position and increase liquidity</li>
<li>To increase the ability to produce in high quantities</li>
<li>To eliminate an original overcapitalization that may have occurred as a result of raised capital</li>
</ol>
<p>Although these are all valid reasons, and are theoretically meant to benefit the shareholder, Graham believes that in practice this is not the entire reality.  Instead, he believes that by retaining a large percentage of earnings from shareholders ultimately hurts them in most cases, because these retained earnings do not result in increased value for the shareholders as much as a compounding dividend would.  He points out examples of companies that supposedly retained a higher percentage of earnings for a “rainy day,” yet when this rainy day happened (somewhere in 1931-1932), the retained earnings that were wiped out did not protect the shareholders as much as simply paying high dividends would have helped them. Therefore, Graham believes that it is better for a company to pay a high percentage of earnings as dividends, regardless of fluctuations in earnings.  He believes that the shareholder is benefited more from a company averaging an EPS of $10 and paying a dividend of $7 per share than a company who averages an EPS of $10 and pays a dividend of $3 per share, despite the fact that the latter would safely cover dividend payments in earnings while the former would have several years where dividends are not covered by earnings. Ultimately, I find all these arguments quite perplexing given the fact that Mr. Warren Buffett, Graham’s apprentice has never paid dividends through Berkshire Hathaway.  That being said, his shareholders are obviously happy to own Berkshire due to the consistent and favorable ROE that Buffett has produced through the years despite retaining all the earnings. Graham does state later in the chapter that there are a small number of firms that can successfully increase shareholder value while paying small or no dividends, but they are far and few.  More likely, the company that fails to pay attractive dividends will put the resultant retained earnings into things that do not increase shareholder value. For example, if a company earns $10/share, pays $3/share in dividends, and spends the remaining $7/share on employee compensation plans or benefits packages, then in the end, the shareholders aren’t receiving much benefit at all!  I can only assume that Warren Buffett is cognizant of this fact, and makes an effort to increase Berkshire’s ROE to compensate for the lack of dividends. All these considerations taken into account, Graham does mention that although he likes to see high dividends paid out, he does not believe that a company should pay high dividends without adequate earnings power to support.  If a company averages an EPS of $5, and pays a dividend of $6/share, then this investment would be rather speculative, as this company is paying dividends at the expense of increasing equity in the business.Stock Dividends<br>*<em>This chapter has been omitted from the 6th edition of Security Analysis</em> In this chapter, Graham discusses two types of stock dividends:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extraordinary</li>
<li>Periodic</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Extraordinary-Stock-Dividends"><a href="#Extraordinary-Stock-Dividends" class="headerlink" title="Extraordinary Stock Dividends"></a>Extraordinary Stock Dividends</h1><p>An extraordinary stock dividend is remarkably similar to that of a “stock-split,” which I believe is a more common practice nowadays (or at least so I’ve gathered through various classes on investing).  The difference is that a stock split explicitly cuts the value of shares in half, or another ratio depending on how low the management wants the share price to go to.  With an extraordinary dividend, the management is increasing the number of shares outstanding via the dividend distribution, which inevitably leads to a diluted market price.  Mechanically, a stock-split and dividend distribution are the same, but often have different effects on the market price as Graham mentions.  He reasons that these extraordinary stock dividends will often be followed by an increase in actual dividend payouts. Graham is clearly not a proponent of this idea, because he believes that it not only deceives unintelligible investors, but also leads to much speculation as a result of a dropping share price.</p>
<h1 id="Periodic-Stock-Dividends"><a href="#Periodic-Stock-Dividends" class="headerlink" title="Periodic Stock Dividends"></a>Periodic Stock Dividends</h1><p>Unlike the extraordinary stock dividends, periodic dividends are paid out at a much more frequent time interval, and in smaller amounts.  These can be used as a way for management to pay out some of the surplus retained earnings that wasn’t covered by the cash dividend, and makes sense for a company who pays a small cash dividend in relation to earnings. Graham is in favor of periodic dividends under the assumption that the cash dividend rate does not fluctuate, and the company does not pay out abnormally large stock dividends that they cannot sustain with their given earnings.  By doing so, the company is effectively giving the shareholders a greater number of shares while continuing at the same cash dividend rate, which results in a greater dividend each quarter/year. Graham also offers a better solution to both extraordinary and periodic stock dividends in the form of stock dividends on preferred stock.  Instead of paying out a stock dividend with common stock, management can do it with preferred shares, which not only allows them to control how much they are paying out of retained earnings, but also doesn’t affect the market price.Analysis of the Income Account (Income Statement)<br>The title of this chapter is slightly misrepresentative of the contents, as the actual analysis of the income statement is much more involved.  Instead, I would label it “Things to look out for when analyzing the income statement,” because Graham discusses some of the common missteps that analysts make when looking at financial statements. He starts off by giving a general “Wall Street Method” for determining the value of a stock, which is represented by the following formula: <strong>Price = Current EPS x quality coefficient </strong> The quality coefficient is meant to reflect various factors including dividend rate/record, the company’s reputation, the type of industry the company is in, and the general sentiment of the market.  Graham states that this coefficient is often inaccurately calculated because too much emphasis is put on the “trends” of the company at the time.((Graham seems to always come back to the pitfalls of assessing a company based on past and current trends)) In addition, Graham makes it clear that an analyst should NEVER rely solely on the income statement as a means of assessment, because it is often a poor indicator of true earnings power without careful analysis of the balance sheet in conjunction with it.  Among these misrepresentations, he lists the following as the most prevalent:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nonrecurrent profits and losses</strong> - In today’s world, some of these are referred to as “extraordinary items,” and as of 2015, FASB has declared that companies are not required to classify material events as “extraordinary.”((<a href="http://ww2.cfo.com/gaap-ifrs/2015/01/fasb-rids-income-statements-extraordinary-items/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://ww2.cfo.com/gaap-ifrs/2015/01/fasb-rids-income-statements-extraordinary-items/)</a>)  This was aimed to eliminate the confusion of what is considered both “unusual and infrequent.”  Those items that do not classify as BOTH unusual and infrequent are required to stay in the main section of the income statement.  This could include something like a strike by workers, because although it is infrequent, it is not unusual for workers to strike.</li>
<li><strong>Operations of Subsidiaries and Affiliates - </strong>Graham was mainly pointing towards those companies who do not use consolidated income statements, which deceives the investor.</li>
<li><strong>Reserves - </strong>Graham was highly critical of what items a company chooses to expense to the “reserves” or “retained earnings” account.  He points out throughout this chapter how many companies (at least back in the 1930s) would include profits from non-operating items in their income statement, yet expense non-operating items to their reserves.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many instances of items that are included in the income statement that do not represent the profits from operating activities, but out of all of them, Graham believed that an investor should focus primarily on the following three:</p>
<ol>
<li>Profit and loss from the sale of fixed assets</li>
<li>Profit and loss from the sale of marketable securities</li>
<li>Buyback of senior securities at a discount/premium</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I am not knowledgeable enough to distinguish the differences between the standards in 1934 and 2016, I will not go into a detailed analysis of Graham’s opinions on all of these items.  Instead, I would like to highlight the point that Graham was trying to make throughout this chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For what the investor chiefly wants to learn from an annual report is the _indicated earnings power _under the given set of conditions, i.e., what the company might be expected to earn year after year if the business conditions prevailing during the period were to continue unchanged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Methods and standards have changed greatly since this book was written, but I believe this line of thinking is timeless to an investor or securities analyst.  Extraordinary Losses and Other Special Items in the Income Account<br>In this chapter, Graham primarily discusses various ways in which the income account can be manipulated by accounting practice in regards to inventory/receivable write-downs, idle-plant expenses, deferred charges, and amortization of bond discounts.</p>
<h2 id="Inventory-Receivable-Write-Downs"><a href="#Inventory-Receivable-Write-Downs" class="headerlink" title="Inventory/Receivable Write-Downs"></a>Inventory/Receivable Write-Downs</h2><p>Usually, at the beginning of a given time period, a company will predict and allocate an amount for the expected write-down of inventory or receivables, because in reality, inventory goes bad, gets stolen, and goes unsold, while receivables are defaulted on.  The allocation for the uncollectibles and inventory write-downs are not the problem, but rather the method that companies treat them on the financial statements.  Graham explains how many companies in 1932 would estimate their write downs, and then charge this lump sum estimate to the surplus account (Accumulated OCI), which means that these expenses (which are operating by nature) are omitted from net earnings, and subsequently, the net earnings are overstated.  Additionally, companies would count the unused allocation for uncollectibles and inventory write-downs as income. Although I am fairly certain that current GAAP standards do not allow companies to directly charge write-downs to the surplus account, this point goes to show just another way that managers and bookkeepers have attempted to artificially inflate income over the years.</p>
<h2 id="Idle-Plant-Expenses"><a href="#Idle-Plant-Expenses" class="headerlink" title="Idle-Plant Expenses"></a>Idle-Plant Expenses</h2><p>Graham then moves on to the concept of charging idle-plant expenses to the income statement, whereby he believes that these should be omitted from operating expenses.  Just because a company has a property that they pay taxes on does not mean that it is part of operating expenses, because at any moment, they could potentially decide to sell off this property, while maintaining the same exact operational efficiency and profit as before.</p>
<h2 id="Deferred-Charges"><a href="#Deferred-Charges" class="headerlink" title="Deferred Charges"></a>Deferred Charges</h2><p>Some charges are spread out of the course of several years (organization expense, moving expense, development expense, discounts on obligations sold), and should be charged against income over the course of the years it is incurred. Unfortunately as Graham states, many companies will take these deferred charges and charge them against surplus as a lump sum when they are initially incurred.  He gives a good example of this with the Kraft Cheese Company.  Prior to 1927, Kraft carried a majority of its advertising outlays as a deferred charge to be absorbed in later years.  In 1926, they spent $1,000,000 in advertising, and charged half of that to current income. The problem arose when in the same year, Kraft charged that 50% of advertising expense to the surplus account, and also charged $480,000 of previous year advertising expenses that had been carried over to the surplus account.  This allowed them to report enormous net income for 1926, which was highly misrepresentative of the actual net earnings.  They later revised this amount when applying to list additional shares on the NYSE, which came out to $461,296 rather than $1,071,000.Misleading Artifices in the Income Account: Earnings of Subsidiaries<br>This chapter deals with two topics, both of which cause a distortion in the EPS on the income statement.  I must note before starting the summary of this chapter that thanks to many regulation improvements put forth by the SEC, most of the written material in this chapter is largely irrelevant to today’s reporting.  Nevertheless, we can glean some valuable insights from this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="Mis-Representative-Accounting-Practices"><a href="#Mis-Representative-Accounting-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Mis-Representative Accounting Practices"></a>Mis-Representative Accounting Practices</h2><p>In this section, Graham discusses several examples of various corporations who through deceptive accounting practices were able to enhance net earnings.  In one example, he shows how a company had substantially increased its goodwill and trademarks during a given year, and claimed that this increase was a result of increased advertising. Another example given explains how the company Park and Tilford used a long-term leasehold previously omitted from the income account to boost earnings over several years.  They claimed that upon appraisal, the leaseholds were worth $20,000,000, and to account for this, they would capitalize this leasehold every 3 months through common stock payable.  Graham states that this practice of increasing net income in this manner is improper (despite adequate disclosure) for several reasons. First, he argues that even if these leaseholds acquired capital value to the occupant, these increases are intangible.  Further, the increases should be added to surplus; not income.  Next, he questions why leaseholds which took place four years prior were being recognized as current income?  Finally, he notes that if the leaseholds did increase in value, this would be shown on the statements, and by capitalizing the asset, the company is counting this appreciation twice. These examples demonstrate deceptive accounting practices back in Graham’s day that are highly regulated and illegal in modern day reporting.  Despite this, we must take an important lesson here, which Graham states at the end of this first section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When an enterprise pursues questionable accounting policies, <em>all</em> its securities must be shunned by the investor, no matter how safe or attractive some of them may appear… You cannot make a quantitative deduction to allow for unscrupulous management; the only way to deal with such situations is to avoid them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This points towards the tendency of human nature, which infers that managers who are willing to cheat once will certainly cheat again.</p>
<h2 id="Padding-Profits-through-Subsidiaries"><a href="#Padding-Profits-through-Subsidiaries" class="headerlink" title="Padding Profits through Subsidiaries"></a>Padding Profits through Subsidiaries</h2><p>In modern day accounting, ALL subsidiaries of a company must be included in consolidated statements, or at least separate statements.  Back in Graham’s day (as he points out), many companies failed to include certain subsidiaries in the financial statements. Graham uses this section to explain how companies have been creative in their utilization of subsidiaries as assurances against loss in various years.  He explains the most common practice of increasing earnings through a “special dividend” from subsidiaries, which is the result of an accumulated surplus from the subsidiary paid out in a lump sum to the owning company.   Another method explained in this section is where the controlling corporation “donates” money to the subsidiary, charges this “donation” to surplus (which doesn’t reduce net earnings), and then taking a dividend including some or all of this “donation” and putting this towards the net earnings for the period. Graham states that although it is often a pain for the analyst account for subsidiaries, it is entirely necessary for subsidiaries to be reported in consolidated statements, because in <em>some cases</em>, the controlling corporation is highly dependent on the subsidiary for operations, and the losses/gains of the subsidiary are highly related to net earnings of the parent company. Graham states that it is the analyst’s job to figure out whether or not the subsidiary’s gains/losses should be retained or omitted from the net earnings of the parent company.  Generally, an analyst can look at historical data to figure this out.  For example, if an analyst sees losses from a subsidiary for several years, and then the <em>sale</em> of this subsidiary, then he/she must conclude that this subsidiary was not a intertwined with the daily operations of the parent, and past earnings should be adjusted (by the way of omitting profits/losses of this particular subsidiary) to reflect the true nature of the parent company. In his grand conclusion to this section, Graham wraps up his analysis in the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is clear, from the standpoint of proper accounting, that as long as a company continues to control an unprofitable division, its losses must be shown as deductions from its other earnings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Relation of Depreciation and Similar Charges to Earning Power<br>In this chapter, Graham opens up his discussion about depreciation, amortization, and other aspects regarding the capitalization of fixed assets on the income statement.  The first half of the chapter mainly discusses accounting loopholes that companies used back in the 1920s and 1930s to overstate earnings and understate depreciation expenses, but nowadays, many of these loopholes are highly monitored.  Although depreciation is still a tricky subject, there aren’t near as many blatantly wrong depreciation practices like there were back in the day.  Although the first half of the chapter is fairly irrelevant, the second half discusses the topic of depreciation in regards to the oil and gas industry (depletion).</p>
<h2 id="Poor-Accounting-Practices"><a href="#Poor-Accounting-Practices" class="headerlink" title="Poor Accounting Practices"></a>Poor Accounting Practices</h2><p>Of the utmost concern when deciding how to depreciate an asset is the depreciation base.  When asset values gain/lose value over time, a company must adjust the base (away from the cost) to properly represent the depreciation and current value of the asset.  Unfortunately, this is a tedious process, and many companies simply didn’t follow it during Graham’s time. Of several examples, Graham mentions one company that intentionally decreased the value of fixed assets in order to decrease depreciation expense and increase earnings, while he then mentions another company which increased the value of fixed assets, yet didn’t adjust the depreciation expense on the income statement. Even further, he gave an example of a company that completely concealed depreciation altogether, and dramatically overstated net earnings as a result. As I noted, these types of practices are less common in 2016 (at least that I know of).</p>
<h2 id="Mining-Companies"><a href="#Mining-Companies" class="headerlink" title="Mining Companies"></a>Mining Companies</h2><p>For companies in the business of extracting oil, gas, sulphur, timber, uranium, etc., they must deplete the value of the land that they are mining over time; similar to the process we use for inventories of product based companies. In the case of mining companies, the accountant must come up with an artificial “base” for depletion, and then choose a method for writing off the expenses against revenues incurred via the “capital asset,” which is often just another way of saying that the company has used the land to its maximum utility. Although Graham does not discuss these various methods, the depletion for mining companies are calculated as follows: <strong>Base: </strong> The base will generally include anything involved in purchasing, preparing, exploring, or repairing the land which is put on the balance sheet as an asset. <strong>Amortization Method </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Percentage depletion method:</strong> a fixed percentage is multiplied by the revenue from the natural resource extracted from the land</li>
<li><strong>Cost depletion method:</strong> this is the most common method, which subtracts the units extracted from the original base.  You take the base divided by the estimated number of units to get the per unit cost, and then use that per unit cost to calculate how much of the asset is depleted each accounting period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graham believes that since depletion is largely based on estimates, the analyst must calculate his/her own amount of depletion based on the price he/she purchased the stock at, and ignore the company’s reported depletion.</p>
<h2 id="Oil-Companies"><a href="#Oil-Companies" class="headerlink" title="Oil Companies"></a>Oil Companies</h2><p>As opposed to mining companies that often will purchase several pieces of land, and then mine these lands for long periods of time, the oil companies will generally have a much quicker turnaround on land.  Because of this, oil companies will generally lease a piece of land, and record the following on the books as possible write-offs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Depreciation of tangible assets</strong> (for example, the oil rigs installed on the new land)<ul>
<li>Graham suggests that these be taken at “established rates,” and the depreciation applied to the cost of the asset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Depletion of oil and gas reserves, based on the costs of the leases</strong><ul>
<li>This is calculated similarly to the description for the mining companies.  Since there are various ways to deplete oil and gas reserves, and is highly dependent on the company, I will not dive into the complications that arises here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unprofitable leases</strong> - since it is sometimes unpredictable as to how much oil can be extracted on a given piece of land, it is considered a part of the operating business to write off unprofitable lands.<ul>
<li>Graham believes that these should always be charged against operating income rather than surplus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Intangible drilling costs</strong> (surveying the land, researching the land, etc.  - anything that doesn’t have a salvage value)<ul>
<li>Graham suggests that even though capitalizing intangible drilling costs is a less conservative practice, it is the best way as opposed to writing them off immediately, which leads to the understatement of earnings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Other-types-of-amortization"><a href="#Other-types-of-amortization" class="headerlink" title="Other types of amortization"></a>Other types of amortization</h2><p>The majority of the chapter focuses on oil and mining companies, but Graham takes the latter portion to briefly discuss a few other scenarios: <strong>Leaseholds and Leasehold improvements - </strong>with leases, there is no capital investment up-front, but many times, the rental payments are significantly lower than the land is worth to the company in sales of natural resources.  This often results in the landlord charging a small royalty on the production of the natural resources.  If the company decides to put a lump sum down for the leasehold, they will amortize the value of the lease over time, and essentially consider these amortized monthly payments as the effective “rent.” In the case that the company were to improve the rented land while using it, they must amortize/depreciate these improvements to a zero salvage value, because at the end of the lease, the landlord effectively owns the improvements, and company no longer benefits from them. <strong>Patents - </strong>Graham states that this is a bit too complicated to include in the current chapter, but notes that patents should be treated exactly like that of a mining property. <strong>Goodwill - </strong>Graham believes that the amortization of goodwill is a rather useless practice, and of minor importance since the value of the goodwill doesn’t have a “useful life” by any definition.  He recommends that the analyst ignore goodwill and its associated amortization altogether.  Public-Utility Depreciation Policies<br>Graham devotes an entire chapter to public-utility depreciation, because he believes that this particular sector (back in his time) was inadequately realizing the effects of depreciation on their assets in comparison to other sectors and more importantly, deviating from classic depreciation theory.  He believed that public-utility companies were of those who should be most scrupulous in their reporting of depreciation.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-a-utility-company-and-why-is-depreciation-so-crucial-to-reporting-accurate-earnings"><a href="#What-is-a-utility-company-and-why-is-depreciation-so-crucial-to-reporting-accurate-earnings" class="headerlink" title="What is a utility company, and why is depreciation so crucial to reporting accurate earnings?"></a>What is a utility company, and why is depreciation so crucial to reporting accurate earnings?</h2><p>A public utility company is any company that provides the infrastructure (and often the service itself) for common needs.  Although back in Graham’s day telecommunications was not prevalent, we can now classify public-utility companies anywhere from electricity providers to telecommunications providers to water suppliers, etc. The reason Graham put forth an effort to speak about public-utility depreciation is primarily because these companies are often monopolies with large sums of earnings.  Even a minor misrepresentation in depreciation could dilute or enhance earnings to a great degree.</p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Depreciation"><a href="#Types-of-Depreciation" class="headerlink" title="Types of Depreciation"></a>Types of Depreciation</h2><p>Each company has several options in calculating depreciation.  These fall into two categories; each of which have several variations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proper/Common Depreciation methods</li>
<li>Retirement Reserve Methods</li>
</ol>
<p>Graham believes that the retirement reserve methods are often deceptive and have lead to overstatement of earnings.  Based on my current education, I have not heard of retirement reserve methods, so am concluding that they have since been eliminated from accounting practice. Additionally, the “proper methods” laid out by Graham have evolved into the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Straight Line method</li>
<li>Accelerated Methods<ul>
<li>Sum of years digits</li>
<li>Declining Balance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Units of Production Method</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Using-tax-based-depreciation-vs-reported-depreciation-for-analysis"><a href="#Using-tax-based-depreciation-vs-reported-depreciation-for-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Using tax based depreciation vs. reported depreciation for analysis"></a>Using tax based depreciation vs. reported depreciation for analysis</h2><p>Graham notes that although companies use various methods of depreciation for reporting purposes, he believes that <em>in general</em>, it is best for the analyst to use the depreciation which has been calculated for tax purposes. I am not knowledgeable enough to comment on this opinion.Amortization Charges from the Investor’s Standpoint<br>This chapter builds on the previous two, and discusses many cases where companies either overstate or understate their depreciation/amortization expenses, which ultimately skew earnings and stock prices.  I found this chapter highly involved, confusing at times, and even a bit redundant, but certainly ascertained some important ideas that Graham puts forth. Graham begins the chapter by illustrating all of the problems that an investor might face when determining a depreciation/amortization estimate through the lens of three companies who had recently purchased trucks.  All of the trucks are the same, but one company overpaid, one company paid fair value, and the other paid fair value but wrote the asset down to $1 on the balance sheet.  The first and final cases are those which the investor should look out for, and Graham does due diligence in elaborating on them.</p>
<h2 id="When-a-company-overstates-depreciation-charges"><a href="#When-a-company-overstates-depreciation-charges" class="headerlink" title="When a company overstates depreciation charges"></a>When a company overstates depreciation charges</h2><p>Graham makes it a point to explain that not all depreciation charges are treated equally.  Although from an accounting basis two companies may report similar figures, it is a high possibility that the nature of these figures are quite different.  For example, one company may have a building (priced at $1,000,000) which is requires constant updating and maintenance charges, while another company has a piece of equipment (also priced at $1,000,000) that clearly deteriorates in value and use over time.  Although accounting policies may treat these identically priced assets similarly, the investor should not. This is where Graham introduces the terms “expended depreciation/amortization” and “obsolescence.”</p>
<h3 id="Expended-depreciation-and-obsolescence"><a href="#Expended-depreciation-and-obsolescence" class="headerlink" title="Expended depreciation and obsolescence"></a>Expended depreciation and obsolescence</h3><p>In the matter of the first case mentioned above, a company could have a situation where the recorded depreciation is much greater than the “expended depreciation,” or in other words, the cost of maintaining the asset each year.  Graham believes that in this type of case, the building is not actually wearing out, and the company is not accumulating a large cash balance for its replacement in the future, so the standard depreciation charge should be omitted and considered as a “risk of obsolescence.”  In other words, when investing in a company like this, you are integrating the chance of the property becoming obsolete (as the result of changing times in an industry, change in operations, etc.) into the price you pay, while calculating the actual earnings based on the “expended depreciation.” For example, consider the scenario for a made up company below, which demonstrates the two methods an analyst could use when determining earnings (assume there are 1,000,000 shares outstanding):</p>

<p>Consider the $780,000 figure as the average expended depreciation over the last 10 years for the company, and the $2,500,000 figure as the reported depreciation expense per the financial statements.  Graham believed that the $2,500,000 was not an operating expense, but more-so an “investment risk” that should only be considered when deciding what price to pay for the stock. As you can see, the analyst’s adjustment reveals a much higher earnings than does the reported earnings.  Graham states that it is of the utmost importance to be able to recognize when to make these adjustments, and when not to.  He states that the decision comes from knowing the business well, and having experience.</p>
<h2 id="When-a-company-understates-depreciation-charges"><a href="#When-a-company-understates-depreciation-charges" class="headerlink" title="When a company understates depreciation charges"></a>When a company understates depreciation charges</h2><p>This part of the chapter is highly involved, and would take a significant portion of time to adequately summarize.  Graham covers everything from the amortization of patents, applications to oil companies, and several highly specific examples. Although there are plenty of variations, companies would generally under-report depreciation through the following process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase a fixed asset</li>
<li>Write that asset down to $1</li>
<li>Deduct the write down from total capital, surplus, or both</li>
</ol>
<p>By doing this, the company would effectively skip the income statement, and fail to charge any depreciation at all to operating expenses.  Graham states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Safety Car (just an example company Graham uses in the book) stockholder does not earn a dollar more on his investment because his fixed assets have been written down to nothing. Nor can necessary expenditures for plant upkeep or replacement be in any wise reduced by making believe that there no longer is any plant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these cases, the analyst should make an adjustment to <em>increase</em> depreciation charges against revenues.</p>
<h2 id="In-Summary"><a href="#In-Summary" class="headerlink" title="In Summary"></a>In Summary</h2><p>At the end of this highly complex and tedious chapter, Graham gives a simple decision matrix for the analyst: <strong>Rule #1 - Accept the recorded depreciation/amortization of a company when…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are based on regular accounting rules applied to fair values of fixed assets AND the net PPE account has not decreased over the years</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule #2 - Reduce depreciation/amortization of a company when…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The company’s reported charges regularly exceed expended depreciation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rule #3 - Increase depreciation/amortization of a company when…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reported charges are consistently less than the average expended depreciation</li>
<li>and… less than the reserve required by ordinary accounting rules based on fair value of the asset</li>
</ul>
<p>After 3 long chapters on the concept of how depreciation affects earnings, Graham finally is ready to move on to the significance of the earnings record in chapter 37.</p>
<p>Significance of the Earnings Record<br>In <a href="http://www.zachgollwitzer.net/book-reviews/security-analysis-graham-dodd-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chapter 27</a>, Ben Graham introduces what he believes to be the “pre-war” and “post-war” methods of investment, whereby he claims that after the war, too much emphasis had been put on earnings trends.  In this chapter, he elaborates on this claim, and explains various situations where earnings averages and trends should have more weight in an analysis and prediction. He begins the chapter by stating that “The concept of earning power has a definite and important place in investment theory.”  He then immediately notes that there is a large distinction to be made on this point.  Sure, average earnings are important in an analysis, but one must determine whether this average is “modal.”((In other words, if a stock averaged $8/share for 10 years, but fluctuated anywhere between $2 and $20, it would NOT be modal))  If it is not, then more caution should be taken when deciding whether to use earnings as a basis for investment.</p>
<h2 id="Quantitative-and-Qualitative-Data"><a href="#Quantitative-and-Qualitative-Data" class="headerlink" title="Quantitative and Qualitative Data"></a>Quantitative and Qualitative Data</h2><blockquote>
<p>Quantitative data are useful only to the extent that they are supported by a qualitative survey of the enterprise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graham points out that although quantitative data such as earnings records has a place in investment analysis, this must be married to a careful qualitative assessment of the business as well.  Sure, a company may show poor earnings for the past few years, but if this company is deeply entrenched in a stable and relatively non-cyclical industry, then it is wiser to put more weight in this company’s <em>average</em> earnings rather than their <em>recent trend.</em> In a different scenario, if a company sells a product that is prone to high levels of competition and obsolescence, and the analyst notices a recent trend of decline in earnings, then it would be smart to pay more attention to this negative trend than the average earnings over the previous period. In both examples, we can see how the analyst <em>starts</em> with quantitative data, and then uses logic and foresight to determine whether or not the quantitative data is relevant. In general, Graham provides two rules for dealing with earnings trends:</p>
<h3 id="When-the-trend-is-upward"><a href="#When-the-trend-is-upward" class="headerlink" title="When the trend is upward:"></a>When the trend is upward:</h3><p>The analyst should base his/her investment valuation on an assumed earning power <em>no higher</em> than earnings that the company has <em>already achieved</em> during normal business. For example, if an analyst sees a company that shows a 2% increase in earnings over a 10 year period, AND notices that the market as a whole hasn’t been all that impressive, then they may project based on the most recent earnings that the stock will go up in the future.</p>
<h3 id="When-the-trend-is-downward"><a href="#When-the-trend-is-downward" class="headerlink" title="When the trend is downward:"></a>When the trend is downward:</h3><p>In Graham’s classic contrarian manner, he states that when the trend is downward, the analyst must put great weight in this trend, and only under extreme circumstances be led to believe that this trend will reverse in the near future.</p>
<h2 id="The-Role-of-Intuition"><a href="#The-Role-of-Intuition" class="headerlink" title="The Role of Intuition"></a>The Role of Intuition</h2><p>It is tempting to be prophetic when analyzing stocks, but Graham warns against it.  He believes that being able to peer into the future is of “inestimable value,” but at the same time, it cannot be expected to be part of the analyst’s stock in trade. Sure, it is useful if an analyst is generally correct in predictions about an industry, but it is dangerous to let a past record of accurate prediction weigh on an analysis.  Instead, one might _start _with intuition, and further investigate it based on the quantitative and qualitative data.Specific Reasons for Questioning or Rejecting the Past Record<br>This chapter is rather short, and is mainly used to give examples of situations where the analyst should be skeptical of predictions made of the company’s future performance based on current and past results. In the first sentence of the chapter, he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In analyzing an individual company, each of the governing elements in the operating results must be scrutinized for signs of possible unfavorable changes in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="The-Rate-of-Output-and-Operating-Costs-for-a-Mining-Company"><a href="#The-Rate-of-Output-and-Operating-Costs-for-a-Mining-Company" class="headerlink" title="The Rate of Output and Operating Costs for a Mining Company"></a>The Rate of Output and Operating Costs for a Mining Company</h2><p>The first example that Graham uses deals with a mining company.  He explains how this company had turned good profits for many years in the past, and how the stock price reflected positive expectations for the future.  These expectations were not valid though, because of the four sources of this company’s profit, 75% of them were limited in life, and expiring within the next few years.  This means that when they expired, the company’s trend of good profits would be limited, and it would be prudent to expect the worst. Another example involving Texas Gulf Sulphur Inc. explains how in June of 1933, the enterprise was selling at a market cap of $32,000,000.  At the same time, the major profits for the future would be coming from a $3,000,000 investment in new property from three large oil companies.  Given the fact that investors were expecting earnings to be over 10X the investment, Graham believes that it would not be a proper “investment,” but more of a speculation <a href="http://www.zachgollwitzer.net/book-reviews/security-analysis-graham-dodd-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as described in his first few chapters of Security Analysis.</a></p>
<h2 id="The-Future-Price-of-the-Product"><a href="#The-Future-Price-of-the-Product" class="headerlink" title="The Future Price of the Product"></a>The Future Price of the Product</h2><p>In addition to examining the outputs and sources of profits for a company, an analyst must also look at the selling price of the company’s product.  If the price of the product is meant to fluctuate in the coming years, historical earnings could be misrepresentative of future earnings. Graham believes that an analyst is speculating at best when trying to predict future prices, but nevertheless may be able to infer from a few clues the general direction of the price. For example, in 1914, it was evident that new mining methods had significantly decreased the extraction costs of copper, which put downward pressure on market prices.  This would cause historically “low-cost producers” to possibly lose their market advantage if they aren’t able to innovate their extraction methods to keep up. As a more relevant example to today’s time, we can think of the tech industry.  Just a few years ago, I remember paying $30 for an 8 GB flash drive, while today, I could pay a third of this price for a 64 GB flash drive.  This change in price may be obvious, but in the case that an analyst is examining something like Kingston Technology, he/she should not forget to consider this lowering of prices over the years when attempting to calculate future earnings.Price-Earnings Ratios for Common Stocks: Adjustments for Changes in Capitalization<br>Unlike many chapters previously, this one give tangible, explicit advice on how to find the intrinsic value of a common stock.  This is highly applicable to even today’s environment, although it is commonly believed that the market is no longer as irrational in pricing as it used to be.</p>
<h2 id="What-an-Analyst-Can-do"><a href="#What-an-Analyst-Can-do" class="headerlink" title="What an Analyst Can do"></a>What an Analyst Can do</h2><blockquote>
<p>Hence the prices of common stocks are not carefully thought out computations but the resultants of a welter of human reactions.  The stock market is a voting machine rather than a weighing machine.  It responds to factual data not directly but only as they affect the decisions of the buyers and sellers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be one of the most famous quotes of the entire book, and for good reason.   Graham is conveying that the price of a stock is often irrational, and largely based on the <em>interpretations</em> of individual investors.  Sure, there may be a lot of information and analysis available to the investor in 2016, but the stock price is still going to reflect the various <em>perceptions and interpretations</em> of that given information.  The Efficient Market Hypothesis states that the market prices reflect all current and relevant information, but it does not say much about _how _this information is reflected.  Sure, the share price of Apple Inc. may incorporate the fact that there was a change in management, or release of a new product, but who is to say that every investor is interpreting this information the same?  Who is to say that all investors are immune to market sentiment? In 2016, we have accurate and abundant information, but human nature has not changed.  We can create computer algorithms that aim to “rationally” interpret information, but at some point, the human has to tell the computer <em>what to do.</em> This debate will perpetually endure, but getting back to the text, Graham states that despite the fact that the analyst cannot put a “proper value” on a stock, he/she can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up a basis for conservative or investment valuation of common stocks, as distinguished from speculative valuations</li>
<li>Use _capitalization structure and source of income _as bearing upon valuation</li>
<li>Find unusual elements in the balance sheet that will have implications upon earnings</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Suggested-Appraisal"><a href="#Suggested-Appraisal" class="headerlink" title="Suggested Appraisal"></a>Suggested Appraisal</h2><p>Graham states that the <em>highest</em> price/earnings ratio that could still be considered “investment grade” is 20. Although quite an arbitrary number, Graham believes this to be a solid benchmark, because anything greater than 20 would cause the investor’s “margin of safety” to disappear.  Despite all this, Graham does say that purchasing a stock above a P/E of 20 <em>could</em> yield great profits, but it is speculative since that particular stock would have to increase earnings to justify such a high appraisal.  Hence, he states that it is safest for the analyst to stay away from stocks above this benchmark, and even aim for a P/E ratio of 12 or 12.5. With such an arbitrary benchmark, one might ask “What earnings should I look at to determine this ratio??” As stated earlier in the text, the current year’s earnings can be used if:</p>
<ol>
<li>The general business conditions in that year were not particularly good</li>
<li>The company has shown upward trends in some years past</li>
<li>The industry is looking optimistic for growth in the coming years</li>
</ol>
<p>If these conditions are not met, the analyst must look to the past 5-10 year average earnings as a means of calculating the P/E ratio. Finally, if the earnings are unstable, Graham believes that the stock is speculative by nature, and the analyst should not worry about trying to find an accurate appraisal.</p>
<h2 id="Allowances-for-Change-in-Capitalization"><a href="#Allowances-for-Change-in-Capitalization" class="headerlink" title="Allowances for Change in Capitalization"></a>Allowances for Change in Capitalization</h2><p>The rule that Graham puts forth in the previous paragraphs does not come without exception.  Sure, the P/E ratio could satisfactory, but the investor must also look at what might happen to the capitalization of the company in the years coming.  At all times, the analyst must be prudent and assume that any stock options outstanding/convertibles WILL be exercised in the future. Consider the example from the book (American Airlines - 1939):</p>
<div id="before-table"></div>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>In addition to these figures, AA had debentures at 4.5% outstanding for $2,600,000; convertible to common stock at $12.50/share.  A true analyst would make the following adjustments based on this information: <strong>New Outstanding Shares = </strong>300,000 + (2,600,000/12.50) = 508,000 shares outstanding <strong>New Earnings = </strong>(2,600,000 * .045)((The interest the company gets back since they no longer have to pay it on the debentures)) + 1,128,000 = $1,245,000 <strong>New EPS = </strong>$1,245,000/508,000 = $2.45 As we can see, assuming that all the debenture holders convert to common stock, the actual EPS is $1.31 <em>lower</em> than explicitly stated at the bottom of the income statement. In a hypothetical scenario, let’s assume that American Airlines was trading at a price of $75.20.  Given the EPS on the published income statement, the analyst would find that American Airlines had a satisfactory P/E ratio of 20.  Accounting for the debentures at the same price, that P/E ratio rises to 30.69, which is considered “speculation.” These types of considerations are extremely important in determining the <em>true value</em> of a common stock.Capitalization Structure and Low-Priced Stocks<br>These two chapters go hand in hand, because chapter 40 introduces the idea of a company’s optimal capital structure, while chapter 41 builds on this to explain why most investors lose money on highly levered low price stocks.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-Optimal-Capital-Structure"><a href="#What-is-the-Optimal-Capital-Structure" class="headerlink" title="What is the Optimal Capital Structure?"></a>What is the Optimal Capital Structure?</h2><p>Graham begins by illustrating how companies with the same exact earnings power are valued at very different prices on the sole basis of varying capital structure.  When he talks about capital structure, he is explaining the ratio between long-term debt and equity (bonds and stock).  I can assume that this is often referred to as the WACC (weighted average cost of capital) these days.  See the data below for an illustration of this:</p>

<p>As we can see, the earnings power of all three companies are nearly identical, but the valuations are vastly different.  This leads Graham into a discussion of the “optimal capital structure,” whereby he concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The optimum capitalization structure for any enterprise includes senior securities to the extent that they may safely be issued and bought for investment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, if a company has a low interest coverage ratio, the are not optimally capitalized, and may pose a risk the investor who needs safety of principal.</p>
<h2 id="Can-Investors-Benefit-from-a-Speculatively-Capitalized-Enterprise"><a href="#Can-Investors-Benefit-from-a-Speculatively-Capitalized-Enterprise" class="headerlink" title="Can Investors Benefit from a Speculatively Capitalized Enterprise?"></a>Can Investors Benefit from a Speculatively Capitalized Enterprise?</h2><p>Graham believes that yes, they can.  He even states that common stock holders will benefit at the expense of the senior security holders in this enterprise because the common stock holder is betting with a very small amount of his/her own money in proportion to that of the senior security holders.  The high leverage of a speculatively capitalized enterprise allows for larger amounts of profits, because more ventures can be undergone through the issuance of large amounts of debt. Graham then adds that if an investor would like to get involved with a speculatively capitalized enterprise, they should look for one in which the majority of the senior securities are preferred stock rather than bonds.  This is advantageous because in down times, the company will simply stop paying preferred dividends in order to curb bankruptcy, which allows the common stockholders to hang on in rough times, and profit from good times.  If the senior securities were mainly bonds, often poor economic times results in bankruptcy((In this case the common stockholders lose all or nearly all their money anyways)) because bond interest payments MUST be paid; regardless of if the company can afford it at the time.</p>
<h2 id="Low-Priced-Stocks"><a href="#Low-Priced-Stocks" class="headerlink" title="Low-Priced Stocks"></a>Low-Priced Stocks</h2><p>Chapter 41 continues the discussion of capitalization structure through the topic of low-priced stocks, which have always been popular among speculators, and are the most common types of stocks which will be “speculatively capitalized.”  Due to human irrationality((See <a href="http://amzn.to/2eTSQZN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow</a> for amazing insights on this very topic)), low priced stocks tend to rise quicker and fall slower than high priced stocks. If this is true, then why don’t more people make money on these low priced stocks? Most of the time, the prices are artificially low as a result of either a dilution of value by offering more shares to the public, stock splits, or simply large stakeholders trying to convince the uninformed public to scoop up tons of stock so they can get it off their hands. Graham says that the way to determine whether a stock is artificially low-priced, or genuinely low-priced is to look at the total capitalization in proportion to assets, sales, and past/predicted profits. ((In other words, by looking at total capitalization in proportion to the size of the enterprise, you can see the true nature of the price.  If the proportion is small, then the stock is most likely “genuine” in its pricing, and will often provide great upside for the investor.))</p>
<h2 id="Other-things-to-look-for"><a href="#Other-things-to-look-for" class="headerlink" title="Other things to look for"></a>Other things to look for</h2><p>Graham introduces a novel idea that having unusually high operating/production costs is the same as having lots of senior debt in the capitalization structure. Additionally, he warns the investor to pinpoint the exact sources of earnings, because in rare cases, companies will earn a majority of their profits through investments outside of their operations (ex: high grade bonds), which often causes an undervaluation of share price.Balance Sheet Analysis: The Significance of Book Value<br>Graham and Dodd are often criticized for their belief in the power of the balance sheet for a “thorough analysis” of a stock.  This first chapter in the section on the balance sheet discusses the significance of a term widely used in Finance; Book Value. Before starting, Graham introduces 5 main benefits that an investor can extract from the analysis of a company’s balance sheet:</p>
<ol>
<li>It shows how much capital is invested in the business</li>
<li>It reveals the ease or stringency of the company’s financial condition (working capital)</li>
<li>It contains details of the capital structure</li>
<li>It provides an important check upon the validity of reported earnings</li>
<li>It supplies the basis for analyzing the sources of income</li>
</ol>
<p>In this particular chapter on book value, we will be addressing point #1 above.</p>
<h2 id="Calculation-of-Book-Value"><a href="#Calculation-of-Book-Value" class="headerlink" title="Calculation of Book Value"></a>Calculation of Book Value</h2><p>Graham makes it a point to define book value, and demonstrate the proper calculation of it.  He defines book value as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of the assets applicable thereto as shown in the balance sheet.  It is customary to restrict this value to tangible assets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then provides the following formula to calculate <strong>book value per share of common: </strong> <strong>BV/share = (common stock + surplus items - intangibles)/number of shares outstanding</strong> *Where surplus items include items marked as surplus + other items which belong in surplus (i.e. reserves for plant improvement and preferred stock retirement, premiums on capital stock, etc.) It must be noted that there is a debate amongst investors as to whether or not intangibles (such as goodwill) should be included in the BV calculation.  Graham himself states that it has become more widely accepted to value intangibles the same as tangibles.  Although most definitions of book value include the omission of intangibles, <a href="http://www.buffettsecrets.com/book-value.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warren Buffett calculates book value as the total equity/total shares (including intangibles).</a> Buffett has argued that a company like Coca Cola has intangible assets with immense value (brand name and recipe) that are worth more than the tangible assets.  Even Graham highlights in this chapter that sometimes, intangibles can be worth <em>more</em> than tangible assets because they don’t face the volatility of competitive pressure, and can often sustain themselves longer than any other asset.  According to the Buffett’s Secrets website, this value is called “economic goodwill,” and is quite important to the valuation of a company.</p>
<h2 id="Current-Asset-Value-and-Cash-Asset-Value"><a href="#Current-Asset-Value-and-Cash-Asset-Value" class="headerlink" title="Current Asset Value and Cash Asset Value"></a>Current Asset Value and Cash Asset Value</h2><p>On top of book value, Graham offers additional metrics for assessing the worth of a company, although he does not elaborate in much detail in this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="What’s-the-point-of-Book-Value"><a href="#What’s-the-point-of-Book-Value" class="headerlink" title="What’s the point of Book Value?"></a>What’s the point of Book Value?</h2><p>Graham states that in years past, book value was of high value to the analyst, because it accurately represented the value of the business.  Nowadays, with all sorts or mergers, acquisitions, and leverage, businesses can earn a much lower/higher amount than represented by the book value. Because of this, Graham states that the only time book value is useful is when the company’s market price is _significantly _deviating from the book value of the company.  This was the case with WorldCom in the years 1996-2003.  In 1999 (as referenced in the forward to this chapter by Bruce Greenwald), the equity value of WorldCom was $125 billion, while the book value of the company was $51.2 billion.  The discrepancy between the two figures (and the fact that 85% of the book value was comprised of goodwill and intangibles) would later cause one of the most controversial bankruptcies and accounting frauds in history, and the CEO to face 25 years in prison. Graham states that because a scenario like this is <em>possible</em>, the investor should always take a quick glance at book value before investing. When such extreme circumstances are not present, Graham believes that book value is of little significance.  Instead of writing any steadfast rules for utilizing book value, Graham uses the topic to introduce the concept of “financial reasoning” and “business reasoning.” These two terms mirror each other in many respects.  Financial reasoning is the logic an investor would use to realize that WorldCom was severely overvalued and headed for disaster by noticing the discrepancy between book value and equity value. Business reasoning on the other hand is the common sense that anyone can apply to any sort of deal they are involved in.  We see this type of reasoning all the time on the popular show “Shark Tank.”  At the beginning of every pitch, the entrepreneur puts forth two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>How much money they want</li>
<li>How much stake in the business the shark who invests will receive in exchange for that money</li>
</ol>
<p>Immediately, the Sharks will find the result of 100%/(offered stake in the business), and multiply that result by the amount of money the entrepreneur is asking for.  This gives the proposed valuation of the business by the entrepreneur.((For example, if someone asks for $10,000 for a 5% stake in the business, they are valuing their business at $200,000)) “Business reasoning” is the simple act of valuing the company based on these two elements, and subsequently deciding whether or not the company is intrinsically worth that valuation to the investor (shark). Graham states as a conclusion to the chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not think, therefore, that any rules may reasonably be laid down on the subject of book value in relation to market price, except the strong recommendation already made that the purchaser know what he is doing on this score and be satisfied in his own mind that he is acting sensibly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think what he is trying to say to the reader is that when analyzing a stock, they should USE COMMON SENSE, and before putting money down, make sure they feel good about the overall valuation they have assigned the business. There are no quantitative figures that will tell an investor that Coca Cola’s secret recipe adds to the value of the business.  Recognizing this value is the job of a skilled investor that has used a combination of business reasoning, financial reasoning, and good judgment.Significance of the Current-Asset Value and Stockholder-Management Relationships<br>In the <a href="http://www.zachgollwitzer.net/book-reviews/security-analysis-graham-dodd-42/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous chapter</a>, Graham discusses the concept of Book Value of a company, and how in current times (back in 1930s - even more pronounced now), the book value did not provide much insight into the value of the company.  Additionally, in the previous chapter, he introduces (but does not elaborate) on cash and current asset value.  This chapter goes into further explanation of these concepts, and develops the following three theses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Current-Asset Value is a good measure of liquidation value</li>
<li>A large number of common stocks sell for less than their liquidation value</li>
<li>It is illogical for a stock to persistently sell below liquidation value, and is either the result of:<ul>
<li>Improper management</li>
<li>Illogical judgments in the market</li>
<li>Various attitudes of the shareholders to their management</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Liquidation-Value"><a href="#Liquidation-Value" class="headerlink" title="Liquidation Value"></a>Liquidation Value</h2><p>Graham offers an example of White Motor Company, whereby he demonstrates the calculation of current-asset value and liquidation value.  He shows how the current asset value is remarkably close to the liquidation value, and therefore concludes that we can use current asset value as an approximate measurement of how much the stockholders will receive in the case of a company’s liquidation.  He notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our object is not to determine the exact liquidating value of White Motor but merely to form a rough idea of this liquidating value <em>in order to ascertain whether or not the shares are selling for less than the stockholders could actually take out of the business.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Stocks-Selling-Below-Liquidation-Value"><a href="#Stocks-Selling-Below-Liquidation-Value" class="headerlink" title="Stocks Selling Below Liquidation Value"></a>Stocks Selling Below Liquidation Value</h2><p>The next point that Graham brings up is the fact that there are many stocks on the market that do in fact sell for less than liquidation value (current asset value &gt; market capitalization).  Thanks to the new-era investment philosophy,((<a href="http://www.zachgollwitzer.net/book-reviews/security-analysis-graham-dodd-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In chapter 27</a>, Graham talks about the New-Theory of common stock investment, which puts an over-proportional weight on current earnings trends and projected earnings into the future, which in part causes stocks that are currently “winning” to trade at an overvalued price while stocks that are trending in the wrong direction will trade at depressed prices)) these stocks are going to have a recent losing record (otherwise their stock price wouldn’t be so low), but Graham believes in some cases, these stocks are undervalued to a great degree, and can benefit a value investor’s portfolio. In order to pick the winners in this category of stocks, an investor should look for companies that show good prospects for the following events to happen in the future (based on judgment by the analyst):</p>
<ol>
<li>Improvement in earnings power (as the result of growing industry or better operational policies and efficiency)</li>
<li>Sale or merger (which can act as a catalyst)</li>
<li>Complete or partial liquidation</li>
</ol>
<p>Since a company with a current asset value less than market capitalization is better off dead than alive, things <em>must</em> change sometime in the future for the company to provide shareholder value.  If a company perpetually trades at a market cap less than current asset value, there is no point of holding it. What an analyst/investor must look out for with this class of securities is the possible decline of current asset value, which will close the discrepancy between the current asset value and market price, and thus turn the stock into a hopeless concern.  If a company shows a decrease in assets over the previous few years in conjunction with an abnormally depressed price on the market, it is clear that this company is not a bargain. Thus, Graham states that “investment bargains” are classified as common stocks that are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selling below their liquid-asset value (current-asset value)</li>
<li>Apparently (based on intelligent and informed judgment) in no danger of dissipating these assets</li>
<li>Have formerly shown a large earning power on the market price</li>
</ol>
<p>The last point is important, because it indicates that the company is in fact a hopeful enterprise (has an upside), and is simply experiencing temporary struggles.</p>
<h2 id="Stockholder-Management-Relationship"><a href="#Stockholder-Management-Relationship" class="headerlink" title="Stockholder-Management Relationship"></a>Stockholder-Management Relationship</h2><p>Although this is technically the next chapter of the text, it fits quite well with the current discussion.  In chapter 44, Graham goes on to explain the various factors that an investor must consider when dealing with management of their vested interests. This chapter is significant because the Wall Street opinion says that current asset value is useless due to the fact that a company will never liquidate, and therefore the value calculated will never be realized by the investor.  Graham believes that this opinion has some merit, but the real issue at hand is the relationship between the company’s corporate management and the respective shareholders. As proven in the previous chapter, a stock which has a current asset value greater than stock value is not of much value if it stays like this.  The investor is primarily interested in such an enterprise for the potential upside it offers. Before explaining how the stockholder-management relationship affects the decision on whether or not to buy these “investment bargains,” Graham takes a moment to highlight the general nature of the common investor.</p>
<h3 id="Typical-Stockholder-Apathetic-and-Docile"><a href="#Typical-Stockholder-Apathetic-and-Docile" class="headerlink" title="Typical Stockholder Apathetic and Docile"></a>Typical Stockholder Apathetic and Docile</h3><blockquote>
<p>It is a notorious fact, however, that the typical American Stockholder is the most docile and apathetic animal in captivity.  He does what the board of directors tell him to do and rarely thinks of asserting his individual rights as owner of the business and employer of its paid officers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graham believes that the average stockholder is of this nature due to the ingrained beliefs that they hold as a result of their learned helplessness:</p>
<ol>
<li>The management knows more about the business than the stockholders do, and therefore its judgment on all matters of policy is to be accepted</li>
<li>The management has no interest in or responsibility for the prices at which the securities sell</li>
<li>If a stockholder disapproves of any major policy of the management, his proper move is to sell his stock</li>
</ol>
<p>These three assumptions held by many stockholders are far from correct.  On top of these beliefs that limit the influence of shareholders, it is clearly an interest of the board of directors to continue doing business despite a persistent current asset value greater than market value.  This conclusion isn’t so much more than a common sense form of reasoning.  If the company is liquidated, the board of directors lose their job, and thanks to our well known nature as humans to act in self interest, regardless of the logical action, the board of directors will NEVER vote to liquidate the enterprise which employs them.  It is therefore up to the “docile and apathetic” shareholders to make this liquidation happen, or at least urge the board of directors to do something about the poor state of the enterprise. Graham then offers some questions that a shareholder should propose to the board of directors when the company is in a financial condition as we have been discussing.</p>
<h3 id="Issues-to-be-Aware-of-in-regards-to-management"><a href="#Issues-to-be-Aware-of-in-regards-to-management" class="headerlink" title="Issues to be Aware of in regards to management"></a>Issues to be Aware of in regards to management</h3><p>Graham implies that any intelligent shareholder who owns a company which is trading less than current asset value would confront management.  First, they would address the issue at hand, and if the board of directors believes that liquidation is not an option, the shareholder may bring up the following issues: <strong>Dividend Policy - </strong>If the company remains in business, shareholders should at least receive dividends proportionate to the liquidating value so they are not losing money by remaining a part of the stagnant business. <strong>Use of cash to repurchase shares - </strong>In the case of a company trading less than current asset value, the management should never be using excess cash to repurchase shares of the company.  Instead, the excess cash should be distributed to the shareholders at a pro-rata basis. <strong>Managerial Compensation - </strong>Thanks to increased SEC regulation, we now have releases of management compensation.  This shouldn’t be an issue, but if a company is trading less than current asset value, the directors should NEVER see an increase in compensation (at least as long as the company remains in this financial state) <strong>To liquidate or not liquidate? - </strong>After confronting the management on these issues, there may be a case for liquidation.  If the management refuses to pay dividends or excess cash payments, then they should (but don’t always) partially, or fully liquidate the company to the benefit of the shareholders. In all, I think what Graham is trying to get across is the idea that as a shareholder, you have a lot more power than you think.  It is your duty and interest to interact with those which you (and other shareholders) employ, and it is their duty to respond in a cordial manner.  This is why Warren Buffett places such an emphasis on finding companies with high quality management.  He simply doesn’t want management that is going to be a pain to deal with.Balance Sheet Analysis (concluded)<br>In this chapter, Graham concludes his analysis of the balance sheet, and does so with a few highly detailed and exhaustive example analyses.  The first half of the chapter is fairly straightforward, while the second portion (with the examples) requires some deep thinking on the reader’s part, and is certainly not a “quick read.”  I will therefore split this brief review into two parts:</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-General-Balance-Sheet-Considerations"><a href="#Part-1-General-Balance-Sheet-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - General Balance Sheet Considerations"></a>Part 1 - General Balance Sheet Considerations</h2><p>Graham begins by stating that although he has mainly covered the analysis of the balance sheet for means of profit, it is much more likely for an analyst to utilize the balance sheet in order to find a company’s financial <em>weakness.</em>  This can be done in many ways, but Graham offers two simple ratios that are commonly used to assess the financial strength/weakness of a company:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Current Ratio</strong> (Graham calls it the “working capital ratio”) - Current Assets/Current Liabilities</li>
<li><strong>Quick Ratio</strong> (Acid Test) - (Current Assets - Inventories)/Current Liabilities</li>
</ol>
<p>Graham believes that a good standard for the current ratio is anything greater than 2, while a good standard for the quick ratio is anything greater than 1.  These are general guidelines, and not free of exceptions.  He gives an example of a company with an inadequate quick ratio, but further explains that this quick ratio is inadequate merely because the seasonal nature of the industry required that particular company to increase their payables in order to fund increased demand for goods.  As always, an analyst should take these arbitrary tests of financial strength with a grain of salt, and constantly question the significance of them in the particular situation at hand.</p>
<h3 id="General-Signs-of-Weakness"><a href="#General-Signs-of-Weakness" class="headerlink" title="General Signs of Weakness"></a>General Signs of Weakness</h3><p>Among many, Graham notes that the following should be analyzed closely by the investor:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Large bank debt</strong> - Although bank debt is not always a bad thing,((Consider a scenario where demand for your product is especially high in the early months of a year.  Taking loans from the bank to increase inventories would be a strategic option.  It is only when companies take loans from the bank for other purposes such as paying off loans, dividends, etc.)) in most cases, the investor should be weary of a company with large amounts of it</li>
<li><strong>Early maturing funded debt</strong> - When notes payable become due, or other forms of debt, it often strains the finances of a company.  Many companies have gone under as a result of lacking enough working capital to pay off current maturing debt.</li>
<li><strong>Intercorporate Indebtedness - </strong>When a subsidiary of a parent company has several instances of debt <em>to the parent</em>, it is something to monitor, but not something to fret about.  In most cases, the parent company will extend the maturity of this debt in perpetuity depending on the ability of the subsidiary to pay it.  In other words, the parent company (assuming their own stability) will make sure that this debt does not put a financial strain on the subsidiary.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Part-2"><a href="#Part-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2"></a>Part 2</h2><p>In the second half of the chapter, Graham states that by comparing balance sheets of a company over time, an analyst can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check-up on the reported earnings per share for consistency between income statement and balance sheet</li>
<li>Determine effect of losses/profits on company’s financial position</li>
<li>Trace the relationship between the company’s resources and earnings power over a long period of time</li>
</ol>
<p>I found this analysis highly difficult to fully understand, and therefore will keep my summary brief. Throughout these analyses, Graham is trying to make two points clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>A loss on the balance sheet (especially in the area of inventory) does not always mean that the company’s financial position has weakened.  A company can very well lose money while strengthening their financial position.</li>
<li>By looking at a company over several decades (rather than year to year), an entirely different story emerges, which could be useful for determining the future prospects of not only that particular company, but the entire industry it operates in.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stock Option Warrants<br>After reading the forward by David Abrams to this section of Security Analysis, I debated whether or not to outline this very chapter.  It discusses the topic of stock warrants, which are essentially the company’s stock options that are bought by the shareholders.  In the preface to the final section of Security Analysis (Additional Aspects of Security Analysis: Discrepancies between Price and Value), David Abrams of Abram’s Capital Management breaks down each individual chapter, and briefly discusses the relative significance of each in today’s environment.  Of the remaining chapters, Abrams notes that this chapter on warrants is the most outdated thanks to the highly complex trading environment we have today in comparison to Graham’s time.  No longer can an investor simply purchase a derivative instrument like a warrant and easily make money on it. Nevertheless, for the sake of education, I decided to outline this chapter.  Graham starts by explaining that a stock option warrant is simply the company’s offering to an investor to purchase issues of their stock at a certain price for a premium.  This is nearly identical to the concept of a “call option,” with the major difference lying in the fact that when stock warrants are exercised, the number of outstanding shares of the company increase, and subsequently the value of the company increases.  In the exercise of a stock option, the company does not make anything, nor do the outstanding shares change, because the option is created and exercised externally from the company on some sort of OTC market. After explaining the basic structure of a warrant, Graham explains how it is a speculative vehicle, what to look for when purchasing a warrant, and how the average shareholder fails to realize the negative effects of a company issuing warrants on his/her own financial interests.</p>
<h3 id="What-to-look-for-in-a-Warrant"><a href="#What-to-look-for-in-a-Warrant" class="headerlink" title="What to look for in a Warrant"></a>What to look for in a Warrant</h3><p>Graham states that when purchasing a warrant, an investor must find one with:</p>
<ol>
<li>A low price (absolutely and relative to the security’s current trading price)</li>
<li>Long duration</li>
</ol>
<p>He notes that without these characteristics, a warrant is no better than purchasing common shares.  Despite this, Graham gives an example of time when a speculator might deviate from these constraints.  He portrays a case where a stock warrant is trading at $0.80 a piece to be exercised at a price of $45, while the market price is a mere $25.25.  In this case, the warrant has a high duration, and a low price, but the exercise price relative to the market price shows a massive discrepancy.  Graham then tells us that this stock jumped to $69.75 shortly after selling warrants at this rate, which would allow the investor who purchased 25 warrants to gain over $550. As one can conclude, the entire fate of the warrant is based on the future price of the security, which throughout the text, Graham constantly reminds the reader is “pure speculation” in most cases.</p>
<h3 id="Warrants-as-a-Part-of-Capital-Structure"><a href="#Warrants-as-a-Part-of-Capital-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Warrants as a Part of Capital Structure"></a>Warrants as a Part of Capital Structure</h3><p>After demonstrating the various conditions in which to purchase a warrant, Graham explains how these warrants fit into the overall capital structure of the company. He states that the “right to benefit from future improvement or enhancement belongs inherently to the common-stock holder,” and the fact that warrants are available dilutes the value to those invested in the common shares of the company.  This is because when the warrants are exercised (which only happens as the result of appreciated capitalization value), more shares are issued, causing the existing shares to be diluted, and limits the current shareholder from recognizing the entire gain from the appreciation in the stock value. Graham therefore gives the following formula: Value of Common Stock Alone = Value of Common Stock + Value of Warrants As a follower of Graham may predict, he is not much of a fan of stock warrants, because he believes that they are a way for a company to raise money without a reason for doing so.  He believes that it is a company’s duty to the shareholders to only raise money when absolutely necessary, and on a pro-rata basis via the spontaneous offering to the shareholders when the need for capital arises.Some Aspects of Corporate Pyramiding<br>Although a relatively short chapter, Graham walks the reader through the structure and danger of corporate pyramiding schemes.  These schemes were relatively new back in Graham’s day, and many investors bought into them.  Today, although I would assume that naive investors would buy into them just like in Graham’s day, the SEC has imposed many regulations that prohibit the construction of a pyramid scheme.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Corporate-Pyramiding"><a href="#What-is-Corporate-Pyramiding" class="headerlink" title="What is Corporate Pyramiding?"></a>What is Corporate Pyramiding?</h2><p>Back in Graham’s day, it was most common to use the title of a “holding company” as a disguise for the workings of the pyramid scheme.  He describes the process of building a pyramid scheme through that of the “Van Sweringen Pyramid,” which was initially started in 1916 through the purchase of the New York Central Railroad Company for $2,000,000 cash and a note totaling $6,500,000.  Graham also points out that the $2,000,000 cash was borrowed, and thus, New York Central Railroad was bought by Sweringen with no cash at all, and gave them control of New York, Chicago, and St. Louis Railroad Company. Next, the holding company incorporated into “Western Corporation” and “Clover Leaf Corporation” in order to buy more companies. Other methods of buying companies included the use of resources from the New York, Chicago, and St. Louis railroads to purchase large amounts of stock in other railroads (Chesapeake and Ohio Railway), as well as forming various “holding companies” to purchase various railroads and even issue securities of these holding companies to the public in order to raise further capital. All of these transactions are quite confusing by nature, and ended up with the “Van Sweringen Holding Companies” owning many railroad and transportation corporations for relatively low amounts of invested capital.  For example, for 0.7% contributed capital, Van Sweringen owned 100% of Virginia Transportation Corp. Graham prints out the various control percentages and contributed capital percentages of Van Sweringen in 1930, which makes it very clear that the entire enterprise was an act of deception, and held little tangible value.  Upon just a few of the holdings filing for bankruptcy, the entire enterprise collapsed, and most of the investors lost all of their money. This goes to show the dangers of corporate pyramiding, which Graham states are fourfold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Corporate pyramiding results in the sale of unsound senior securities to the public</li>
<li>The common stock of the governing holding companies can appreciate at rapid rates during boom cycles, which leads to massive speculation (and an inevitable collapse at the turn of the cycle)</li>
<li>The management is generally poor or at least misaligned with investor interest because they hold so little capital in the business</li>
<li>Through corporate pyramiding, it is easy to pull off deceptive accounting techniques such as the overstatement of earnings/dividends</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Are-all-holding-companies-bad"><a href="#Are-all-holding-companies-bad" class="headerlink" title="Are all holding companies bad?"></a>Are all holding companies bad?</h2><p>Graham finishes the chapter by stating that just because he has only given examples of holding companies as the source of corporate pyramiding, they are not inherently bad, and there are many other ways to pull off this scheme.  Specifically, he notes of a company who pulled off corporate pyramiding through the excessive issuance of preferred stock.</p>
