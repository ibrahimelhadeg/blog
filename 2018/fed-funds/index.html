    <p>If you type in “fed funds rate” into Google, the top result is an Investopedia article describing what the fed funds rate means.  Although the article generally explains what this esoteric term really means, the reader is left grappling with the meanings of terms used throughout the article such as “FOMC”, “prime lending rate”, “open market operations”, “reserve ratio”, “contractionary monetary policy”, “money supply”, and many more.  Furthermore, what does it mean when the Wall Street Journal puts a headline on the front page that says <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-raises-interest-rates-signals-one-moreincrease-this-year-1537984955" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Fed Raises Interest Rates, Signals One More Increase This Year”</a>?  </p>
<p>After reading that front page article, you’re left wondering what the “yield curve” is, what “interbank lending” means, and why all these economists are so hyped up about such a dry and boring subject.  To make matters even more frustrating, the entire world of finance talks about this subject as if it were basic Algebra and everyone should easily understand it.</p>
<p>Although the basic premise of the fed funds rate may be simple, it touches on a slew of topics that ultimately govern how we as consumers live our daily lives.</p>
<p>This not so brief post will walk through the federal reserve system in just enough detail to allow the reader to grasp the importance of the fed funds rate, and hopefully, will allow one to see the effect that this single metric has on their daily life.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-“Fed-Funds-Rate”"><a href="#What-is-the-“Fed-Funds-Rate”" class="headerlink" title="What is the “Fed Funds Rate”?"></a>What is the “Fed Funds Rate”?</h1><p>A natural starting point to this journey is to define what the fed funds rate means.  In short, the fed funds rate is the effective short term interest rate for the U.S. Economy.  Technically, it is the interest rate which banks charge other banks to lend reserve balances “overnight”.</p>
<p>Just one sentence in, you probably already have questions like: </p>
<ol>
<li>Why would banks lend to other banks?</li>
<li>What does “overnight” mean?</li>
<li>What is the significance of a short term interest rate?</li>
</ol>
<p>That is why starting with the definition of the fed funds rate is not sufficient to understanding it.  The better starting point would be a primer on what the Federal Reserve is.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-Federal-Reserve"><a href="#What-is-the-Federal-Reserve" class="headerlink" title="What is the Federal Reserve?"></a>What is the Federal Reserve?</h1><p>Many people have heard of the Federal Reserve, but do not understand its function.  For lack of a better term, the Federal Reserve is just another bank.  It becomes more confusing when you find out that this bank is not one, but 12 regional reserve banks, and the banks are run by the government.  The twelve federal reserve banks are located in the following cities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Boston</li>
<li>New York*</li>
<li>Philadelphia</li>
<li>Cleveland</li>
<li>Richmond</li>
<li>Atlanta</li>
<li>Chicago</li>
<li>St. Louis*</li>
<li>Minneapolis</li>
<li>Kansas City</li>
<li>Dallas</li>
<li>San Francisco</li>
</ol>
<p><em>I have left stars by the New York and St. Louis Federal Reserve Banks because they will be of interest to us later.</em></p>
<h2 id="Why-was-the-Fed-Created"><a href="#Why-was-the-Fed-Created" class="headerlink" title="Why was the Fed Created?"></a>Why was the Fed Created?</h2><p>The Federal Reserve system was created in 1913 for one primary reason–to alleviate the pain of financial crises.  The idea was if you had a central bank that could regulate other banks, the country would be less prone to financial disasters and the government could have a greater say in monetary policy. I have no appetite to discuss the ideological controversies over the reasons for the Fed in this post.  For those who oppose heavy government intervention, the Fed can be a touchy subject.  If you have any desire to go down the rabbit hole, I suggest checking out <a href="https://amzn.to/2CIqrW6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Creature from Jekyll Island</a>, which provides a borderline conspiracy theory perspective on the Federal Reserve.</p>
<h2 id="Who-runs-the-Fed"><a href="#Who-runs-the-Fed" class="headerlink" title="Who runs the Fed?"></a>Who runs the Fed?</h2><p>As mentioned above, the government runs the fed, but this often just confuses people more than anything.  Logistically, the Fed runs just like every other bank in the United States.  It has a board of directors (they call it the FRB, or Federal Reserve Board of Governors) and shareholders (member banks, not the public).  It makes loans, takes deposits, and invests in securities just like any other bank.</p>
<p>To make things more realistic, let’s take a look at the Federal Reserve vs. a prominent U.S. Bank, JP Morgan.</p>
<div id="before-table"></div>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>JP Morgan</th>
<th>Federal Reserve</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Assets</td>
<td>$2.5 T</td>
<td>$4.4 T</td>

<tr>

<td>$24 B</td>
<td>$81 B</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Yes, JP Morgan is the largest U.S. Bank, and yes, the Federal Reserve bank (this combines all 12 regional banks) makes JP Morgan look small, but the point of showing this is to illustrate that the Fed is just another bank that makes revenue, manages expenses, and controls the size of its balance sheet.  Furthermore, the Fed is audited by KPMG, while JP Morgan is audited by PWC, which shows that there is private sector oversight into the Fed.</p>
<p>The Fed is currently run by its board of governors, and the chairman of this board is Jerome Powell, whom was appointed by President Trump.  The Fed, just like JP Morgan, has a CFO, CTO, and other common positions.  To see the entire staff, you can visit <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/officialstaff.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this page on the Fed’s website</a>.  To see the Fed’s 2017 combined financial statements, you can see [the annual report here] (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/combinedfinstmt2017.pdf)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/combinedfinstmt2017.pdf)</a>.</p>
<p>To sum everything up, an important thing to realize about the Federal reserve is the fact that it runs and is operated in a similar fashion as any bank, and makes money the same way a bank like JP Morgan does.  A few key differences exist such as the fact that the Fed is not for profit and the shareholders of the Fed are member banks rather than the American public, but matters are simplified when one realizes that the Fed is not some untouchable organization that can spend trillions of dollars at the touch of a button, but an organization that pays salaries, pays dividends, and is governed by a board of directors.</p>
<h1 id="So-what-is-the-fed-funds-rate"><a href="#So-what-is-the-fed-funds-rate" class="headerlink" title="So what is the fed funds rate?"></a>So what is the fed funds rate?</h1><p>At this point, we are more versed to discuss the topic of the fed funds rate.  We know that the fed was supposedly created to prevent recessions and govern monetary policy, but how does it do it?</p>
<h2 id="Let’s-talk-about-money-supply"><a href="#Let’s-talk-about-money-supply" class="headerlink" title="Let’s talk about money supply"></a>Let’s talk about money supply</h2><p>Let me again divert from the original question to talk about the money supply in the country.  When talking about supply and demand, it is tough to imagine that the same laws that determine the price of the gas you put in your car, the groceries you buy at the store, and the TV you just put in the living room are the laws that determine how much money costs.  But what does the cost of money even mean?  How could money have a cost when it is the cost in the first place?!  To understand this, we need explore an overly simplified example (feel free to sketch the following examples out on a sheet of paper as it will make more sense).</p>
<p>Let’s say that the cost of an apple anywhere in the United States is $1, and there are a total of 10,000 apples across the U.S. right now.  The reason that the apples cost $1 is because the supply of apples (10,000) is roughly equal to the demand of apples (10,000).  Now, let’s imagine that tomorrow, a hurricane wipes out half of the apple fields in the US, and the supply of apples is reduced instantly to 5,000 total apples.</p>
<p>Considering the demand for apples has not changed (I don’t care that a hurricane wiped out the apple trees.  I just want to eat an apple!), we can assume that tomorrow, the supply of apples will be 5,000 and the demand for apples will be 10,000.  When the supply was 10,000 and the demand was 10,000, we could determine the $1 per apple price by dividing supply by demand, or 10,000/10,000 = 1.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, those numbers have changed, so our price is now 10,000/5,000 = 2.  The price has doubled!</p>
<p>Now, let’s translate this into the cost of money.  Let’s assume that in the entire United States, there is a total of $10,000 dollar bills in circulation.  Just like an apple, you can “buy” money in the form of a loan.  The only difference is that you eat an apple and pay a price of $1 to do so, while you utilize a loan and may be willing to pay 0.01% interest on that loan to use it.  To illustrate this, we can assume that there are two people in the entire US who need $5,000 each in loans.  Therefore, the demand for dollar bills is $10,000, and the supply is $10,000, so the interest rate paid for these loans would be $1, or expressed as a percentage, $1/$10,000 = 0.01%.  Now, let’s say that some nefarious person gets their hands on $5,000 of the outstanding $10,000 supply of money in the U.S., and lights a match to it.  As the dollar bills burn out of existence, the supply reduces in half to $5,000.  We still have two people who both want $5,000 loans, so the supply is still $10,000.  Therefore, the price of money is now $10,000/$5,000, or $2.  Expressed as a percentage, this would imply a 0.02% interest rate.</p>
<p>Although the two examples with apples and money are overly simplified and entirely unrealistic (I sure wish I could borrow money for 0.01%!), they demonstrate a critical concept; the cost of money.  Money, just like apples, has ownership value.  They have value for different reasons (I value the apple because it feeds me, while I value the money because it feeds my business), but nevertheless still have value.  Coming back to our discussion of the Fed, we can remember these two examples when we talk about the money supply in the United States.  Obviously, $10,000 is not the real total of bills floating around the United States, but how does one determine the true number?  Well, nobody knows this number to the penny, but the St. Louis Federal Reserve publishes money supply numbers periodically.  The St. Louis Fed has a department called <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“FRED”</a> which publishes not only monetary statistics, but statistics on GDP, industry performance, foreign investment, and just about anything else you wanted to know about when it comes to money.  Of the 12 Federal Reserve regional offices, the St. Louis Fed may be the most well known for this very data source.</p>
<p>So what kind of money supply statistics does FRED publish?  What do we classify as money?  In our above example, money represented paper notes (i.e. a dollar bill that you have in your wallet), but money could also be defined as many other things.  What happens when I pay for a car on credit?  Where did that “money” come from?  For the sake of our original discussion (the fed funds rate if you forgot), we are going to be talking about the simpler definitions of money, which includes the paper money as in our example above and the deposits held at banks across the country (which act like paper money).</p>
<p>FRED publishes several versions of “money supply” which includes MB (monetary base), M1, M2, and M3.  These define the amount of “money” in the U.S. Economy in decreasing levels of specificity (i.e. MB is smaller than M3).  For the sake of our discussion on fed funds rate, we will be talking about MB and M1.</p>
<h3 id="MB-Monetary-Base"><a href="#MB-Monetary-Base" class="headerlink" title="MB (Monetary Base)"></a>MB (Monetary Base)</h3><p>The monetary base consists of three components:</p>
<ol>
<li>The amount of notes in circulation (dollar bills as in the example above) </li>
<li>The total reserve balances at the federal reserve banks </li>
<li>The total vault cash at banks</li>
</ol>
<p>The monetary base represents the total amount of central bank (Fed) money in circulation, and can be a bit tricky to understand.  The first part is easy, as it represents the total amount of dollar bills circulating through the economy.  If you added up every person’s physical wallet of cash, you’d have this number.  This is what we were referring to in the above examples.</p>
<p>Parts 2 and 3 (often considered one and the same) are a bit more difficult to understand.  Part of the Federal Reserve system requires by law that each bank keep a certain amount of “vault” cash and/or reserve notes at the federal reserve banks.  Huh??</p>
<p>Remember, the Fed is just a bank, which means that they have deposits just like any other bank.  Instead of consumers like you and I, the Fed takes bank cash as deposits.  It is easiest to explore this through an example.  Let’s say that I open a bank and 5 people give me $100 each to watch over.  I have 5 “depositors” at a total of $500 in “deposits”.  Of course I want to use this $500 to make loans, but the Federal reserve requires that I keep a certain portion of it “liquid”.  For this example, we’ll say that the Fed requires that my bank keeps $100 of the $500 on hand as “liquid” money.  The Fed gives me two options on where I can keep this $100.  </p>
<ol>
<li>I can keep it at my actual bank (in the vault)</li>
<li>I can keep it at one of the 12 federal reserve banks as deposits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why would the Fed require banks to keep a percentage of their deposits in the “vault”?  To ensure systematic financial stability.  </p>
<p>The banks need to be able to hand their depositors physical cash at any time.  But just how much does each bank have to keep as “vault cash”?  This amount depends on the size of the institution (by number of deposits).  The table below shows how much different banks must hold in vault cash and/or reserves at the federal reserve.</p>

<p>These figures are updated and maintained at [this link on the Fed’s website] (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm)</a>.</p>
<p>You may wonder what types of banks are subject to these regulations?</p>
<p>All “depository institutions” are required to keep these amounts of reserves, and this would include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commercial Banks - what most people think of as a “bank” (JP Morgan) </li>
<li>Savings Banks - any bank that manages savings accounts (also JP Morgan) </li>
<li>Savings and Loans - also referred to as “Thrifts”, these institutions make consumer mortgage loans</li>
<li>Credit Unions</li>
<li>U.S. branches of foreign banks</li>
<li><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/edgeactcorporation.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edge corporations</a> - a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. bank</li>
<li><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agreementcorporation.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agreement corporations</a> - very similar to an edge corporation</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, what’s going on with the 0% reserve requirement for banks with less than $16 M in deposits?  Just because the Fed does not put a requirement on these banks, they will still hold vault cash in the proportion they deem sufficient for covering withdrawal requests of depositors.  The Fed simply does not worry about such institutions because their bankruptcy would not jeapordize the U.S. economy significantly.</p>
<p>In summary, the monetary base represents the amount of central bank money available in the economy.  At the time of this writing (October 2018), <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGMBASE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the MB is $3.6 T</a>, which is split between $1.7 T of physical cash and $1.9 T of “vault cash”.  Compared to the MB figure of $829 B 11 years ago, one can see that the total supply of money in the financial system has dramatically increased since the financial crisis of 2008.</p>
<h3 id="M1-Money"><a href="#M1-Money" class="headerlink" title="M1 Money"></a>M1 Money</h3><p>In the above section we discussed the definition of the monetary base, but economists also use “M1 money” as a proxy for the amount of spendable cash in the economy at a given time.  In our examples with apples and cash, we spoke only of physical cash, but more realistically, we should have been talking about physical cash plus checking account deposits at all the banks.  M1 is just that–it represents all of the physical cash in the economy plus all of the checking account deposits at banks (excluding reserves held at the Fed).  To be clear, “checking account deposits” represent how much you have deposited at your bank that is free to withdraw at any moment.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right–M1 excludes the reserves or “vault cash” that we spoke about above.  In other words, MB and M1 overlap in some areas, and not in others.</p>

<p>Above shows where MB and M1 overlap and where they deviate.  In summary, we can call MB “Central Bank Money” and M1 “Commercial Bank Money”.  At the time of writing, MB is $3.6 T while M1 is $3.7 T.  If you split these into their component parts, that leaves us with $1.7 in physical cash, $2 T in checking deposits, and $1.9T in reserves/vault cash.  For the sake of our discussion, we will be referring to the MB (monetary base) metric as it represents the money supply that the Fed will manipulate to set the fed funds rate.</p>
<h1 id="So-now-can-we-understand-how-the-fed-funds-rate-is-set"><a href="#So-now-can-we-understand-how-the-fed-funds-rate-is-set" class="headerlink" title="So now can we understand how the fed funds rate is set?"></a>So now can we understand how the fed funds rate is set?</h1><p>To this point, we have learned that the Federal Reserve is a bank with about $4.4 T in assets and $81 B in net income (reported year end 2017).  We learned that this bank is governed by the FRB (Federal Reserve Board of Governors) with Jerome Powell (appointed by Trump) as the chairman of the board.  Furthermore, we learned that their are 12 regional federal reserve locations that all roll up into the consolidated system we call the “Federal Reserve”.  We learned that interest rates are the “cost” of money, and this cost is largely determined by the supply and demand of money in the economy, which is represented by MB and/or M1 depending on who you talk to.</p>
<p>Knowing these concepts, we can finally start to explore the function of the Fed to set a fed funds rate; a critical component to the U.S. Government’s monetary policy.  A great place to start is on the topic of interbank lending.</p>
<h2 id="Interbank-Lending-and-the-fed-funds-rate"><a href="#Interbank-Lending-and-the-fed-funds-rate" class="headerlink" title="Interbank Lending and the fed funds rate"></a>Interbank Lending and the fed funds rate</h2><p>Banks like JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, US Bank, and others are all required to keep a required 10% of their deposits as either vault cash, deposits at one of the federal reserve banks, or a combination of the two.  They must keep 10% because they all have greater than $124 M in deposits.  All of this seems simple enough, but what happens if one of these banks (or any depository institution for that matter) falls below their required reserve ratio?  In reality, this happens quite often, and banks need to borrow cash “overnight” to meet the required reserve ratio.  Banks are inclined to maximize their profits, which means that sometimes, they will loan more of their deposit funds than allowed.  This causes them to fall beneath the reserve requirement.</p>
<p>If you recall, borrowing money is not free, and when a bank has to take a loan overnight, they have to pay some rate of interest on that loan.  So where does the bank with a deficit of reserves go to restore their reserve requirement?  Although technically speaking the bank could get this cash from anywhere, they will be looking at two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Federal Reserve Discount Window</li>
<li>Interbank lending</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s first tackle the discount window because it is fairly simple.  The federal reserve offers funds to banks at a fixed overnight rate.  <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20181023a1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As of this writing, the “discount rate” is at 2.75% interest</a>.  This is the “primary rate” offered by each of the 12 regional federal reserve banks to other banks that operate in their region.  If a bank branch approves too many loans in one day and falls $10 M below their reserve requirement, they have the option to borrow $10 M from their regional federal reserve branch at an interest rate of 2.75% until the loan is repaid (usually by the next day).</p>
<p>But in reality, banks will not borrow from the Fed’s discount window.  Instead, they will borrow from other banks.  This is entirely by design.  The Federal Reserve sets the discount rate at a premium to “fed funds rate” to encourage banks to lend to each other rather than obtaining funds from the discount window.  In the latest FRB meeting, [Chairman Powell and colleagues decided] (<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20181023a1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/monetary20181023a1.pdf</a>) to set the discount rate at 2.75% and the fed funds rate at 2-2.25%.  In other words, the rate which banks charge each other for overnight loans is currently between 2-2.25%, which is more attractive than the discount window.  This is the essence of interbank lending, and is why the “fed funds rate” is often considered the rate which banks lend to each other.</p>
<p>But how does the Fed get the banks to lend to each other at this rate?  Why is a range rather than an exact number?</p>
<p>What many people do not understand is that the fed funds rate is actually a <em>target range</em> rather than an exact number.  Although the Fed can charge an exact 2.75% for its <em>own</em> loans, it cannot force all the banks in the U.S. to charge some exact rate.</p>
<p>The rate charged by each of the banks is determined largely by market forces (remember our apples example).  A perfect example of this was 2008.  During the crisis, liquidity in the markets dried up, which is another way of saying that the supply of money was far less than the demand for money.  Every bank <em>needed</em> cash, but since nobody trusted each other, the supply of money was depressed.  This caused the cost of money (fed funds rate) for overnight lending to skyrocket, and all of a sudden, banks were charging upwards of 6% for loans to other banks.  This is a perfect example of how the “effective fed funds rate” can be different than the fed funds <em>target</em> rate.</p>
<p>And this is where the “lender of last resort” steps in.  You may have heard this phrase used to refer to the Federal Reserve because in 2008 when all of this was happening, it actually lowered the discount rate.  Since the effective fed funds rate (interbank lending rate) had gotten out of control, banks had to go to the Fed’s discount window for emergency funding to meet their reserve requirements.  The Fed lowered the discount rate to encourage lending, which added liquidity to the system.  This all makes sense, but there is just one very crucial piece of information that we are leaving out of the equation here.</p>
<p><em>How does the Fed raise or lower rates?</em></p>
<p>We have finally reached the peak and finale of the discussion.  Enter the FOMC.</p>
<h2 id="FOMC-Federal-Open-Market-Committee"><a href="#FOMC-Federal-Open-Market-Committee" class="headerlink" title="FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)"></a>FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)</h2><p>Although the Fed could alter the supply of money (MB) by increasing/decreasing the reserve requirement or by raising/lowering the discount rate, the most common method for altering the supply of money in the economy is by conducting what the Fed calls “open market operations”, or OMO for short.  These OMO are governed by <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FOMC</a>, which is the single government committee that has the power to conduct what politicians refer to as “monetary policy”.</p>
<p>The fed funds rate does not just magically move after the FOMC decides to raise or lower it.  The Fed must actually intervene in the economy to reach its target.</p>
<p>After an FOMC meeting where rates are altered (for example, the most recent FOMC meeting resulted in a 0.25% rate increase), the treasury desk of the New York Fed will conduct open market operations to meet the desired target.  In the last section of this post, we will explore what OMO are and ultimately how monetary policy is conducted in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="Open-Market-Operations-OMO"><a href="#Open-Market-Operations-OMO" class="headerlink" title="Open Market Operations (OMO)"></a>Open Market Operations (OMO)</h1><p>Attempting to explain OMO without explaining how the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet works would be quite futile, but as this post has extended far past the originally intended length, here is the executive summary for the lengthy section to come.</p>
<ul>
<li>The New York Regional Branch of the Federal Reserve is in charge of conducting open market operations</li>
<li>Primary dealer banks (usually investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, etc.) sell or buy Government bonds (U.S. Treasuries) to expand or contract the money supply, which effectively alters the fed funds rate </li>
</ul>
<p>If the above summary is sufficient for your liking, consider this post finished.  If you’re like me and get frustrated reading that same old executive summary for the hundredth time, keep reading.</p>
<h2 id="The-Fed’s-Balance-Sheet"><a href="#The-Fed’s-Balance-Sheet" class="headerlink" title="The Fed’s Balance Sheet"></a>The Fed’s Balance Sheet</h2><p>As a primer to OMO, we need to understand the composition of the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/combinedfinstmt2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet</a> at a high level.  More specifically, we need to understand what is called the “SOMA”, or “System Open Market Account”.  This is a term that refers to all of the securities that the Federal Reserve holds as assets on its balance sheet.  As of the year ended 2017, it includes the following items (and their corresponding percentage of total SOMA).</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. Treasuries ($2.5T, or 58%)</li>
<li>Federal Agency and Government Sponsored Enterprise Mortgage Backed Securities ($1.8 T, or 41%)</li>
<li>All Other Assets ($62.9 B, or 1%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare the SOMA in 2017 (above) to <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/annual07/sec6/c3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOMA in 2007</a> (below).</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. Treasuries ($746 B, or close to 100%)</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason that the Fed carries so many U.S. Treasuries is due to the fact that the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 restricts it from dealing with virtually all securities except Treasuries.  The financial crisis certainly caused those rules to slightly adjust, and the balance sheet subsequently grew from around $800 B to $4.5 T, or a $3.8 T increase.</p>
<p>The reason for explaining the SOMA is because this is the part of the Balance Sheet that will grow/shrink as a result of two types of OMO: </p>
<ol>
<li>Permanent OMO</li>
<li>Temporary OMO</li>
</ol>
<p>Permanent OMO will permanently alter the composition of the Fed’s SOMA account while Temporary OMO will simply shift numbers around without actually impacting the balance sheet size.</p>
<h2 id="Permanent-Open-Market-Operations"><a href="#Permanent-Open-Market-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Permanent Open Market Operations"></a>Permanent Open Market Operations</h2><p>Prior to the financial crisis, permanent operations were commonly the only type of OMO that the fed conducted.  In permanent OMO, the Fed works with a set of primary “dealers” who will “make a market” for U.S. Treasury bonds.  The Fed will then either sell or buy these Treasury bonds through the dealers.  The dealers are updated each year, and generally consist of Capital Markets divisions of large banks. This could include firms such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, etc.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_dealer#Current_primary_dealers_with_the_Fed eral_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A full list of dealers can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>There are two scenarios we need to understand.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Fed wants to raise the fed funds rate</li>
<li>The Fed wants to lower the fed funds rate</li>
</ol>
<p>Going back to our example with the apples in the economy, we know that to increase the cost of money, we must lower the supply of money.  To raise rates, the Fed must decrease the supply of “MB” or monetary base in the economy.  Here is the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>FOMC decides to raise rates 0.25%</li>
<li>The Fed takes U.S. Treasuries from the SOMA account and issues them to institutional investors, banks, and the public <em>through</em> the Fed’s network of dealers</li>
<li>The investors and banks purchase the Treasuries, which reduces the amount of cash they have on hand, and reduces the supply of money (M1) in the economy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conversely, we know that to decrease the cost of money, we must increase the supply of money.  To lower interest rates (as the Fed did during the financial crisis), the Fed will “print money” in order to purchase Treasury securities from dealers.  This increases the supply of money in the economy, and lowers interest rates.</p>
<p>Up until the financial crisis, monetary policy was conducted largely as described above, and still is to an extent.  As shown by the 2017 balance sheet above, the Fed now has trillions of dollars of Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) as well as Treasuries.  To effectively save the financial system from collapsing, the Fed not only purchased U.S. Treasuries from dealers, but also purchased a large portion of the distressed Mortgage Backed Securities that were causing banks across America to fail.  This took the pressure off the rapidly defaulting asset books of banks and injected liquidity to the financial system (for a more detailed account of this, I highly suggest reading <a href="https://amzn.to/2ENkLMZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Big Short</a>).</p>
<p>With this move to save the system, the Fed now must manage a balance sheet that it has never done before, which involves both permanent OMO, but also temporary OMO in the form of “reverse repurchase agreements”.  A more comprehensive view into some of the balance sheet strategies can be found in the <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/omo/omo2017pdf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OMO report by the New York Fed.</a></p>
<h2 id="Temporary-Open-Market-Operations"><a href="#Temporary-Open-Market-Operations" class="headerlink" title="Temporary Open Market Operations"></a>Temporary Open Market Operations</h2><p>At this point, we have covered the main way that the Fed alters the fed funds rate.  That said, since the Fed bought trillions of dollars of MBSs during the financial crisis as a part of its “Large Scale Asset Purchase Program”.  From January 2009 to August 2010, it purchased (i.e. expanded the size of the SOMA account) over $1.25 T in agency (Fannie and Freddie) mortgage backed securities.  <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/regreform/reform-mbs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This page</a> gives a closer look at this program, and even has an Excel spreadsheet at the bottom of the page of every repurchase related to this program which is quite interesting to look through. </p>
<p>With such a large scale asset repurchase program, the size of the SOMA account at the Fed dramatically increased as discussed above, and now, the Fed must slowly reduce the size of the balance sheet.  To do so, in December of 2015, the Fed announced a “normalization” program where they will conduct a series of “Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements”, and will allow the existing securities on the balance sheet to mature without reinvestment.  We will walk through both strategies.</p>
<h3 id="Overnight-Reverse-Repurchase-Agreements-ON-RRPs"><a href="#Overnight-Reverse-Repurchase-Agreements-ON-RRPs" class="headerlink" title="Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements (ON RRPs)"></a>Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements (ON RRPs)</h3><p>When we talk about “Temporary OMO”, we are mainly discussing ON RRPs.  This is what the Fed uses as a primary tool to temporarily influence the fed funds rate and conduct monetary policy.  The Fed will conduct these operations with primary dealers and also “reverse repo counterparties”, which is a <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/rrp_counterparties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">separate list of financial institutions</a> who the Fed will sell securities to on an overnight basis.</p>
<p>So what is a Repo?  What is a reverse Repo?  What is an “overnight” reverse repo?</p>
<p>Don’t be intimidated by the terminology, because these are quite simple.  We will start with a Repo transaction.  This is where the Fed will purchase a security (usually a Treasury bond) from one of its primary dealers with the counterparty promising to buy that security back in the future.  Essentially, the Fed is injecting money into the bank which it bought the security from for a short time.  The Fed has not conducted a Repo since 2008.</p>
<p>A “reverse repo” is simply the reverse of a repo.  Instead of buying a security from a primary dealer, the Fed takes a security from the SOMA account (usually a Treasury bond) and sells that security to either a primary dealer or to one of the reverse repo counterparties linked to earlier.  You might ask why a bank or financial institution would be interested in buying a security from the Fed?  They are incentivized to purchase because the Fed will purchase that same security back in the future for a premium.  Not only is the bank purchasing a security that returns them money, but since it is the Fed, this security holds zero risk on their balance sheet, which is highly important to a financial institution.</p>
<p>An “overnight” reverse repo is simply a short term reverse repo.  The Fed sells a security to a bank for a day or two and buys it back at a premium.  This <em>temporarily</em> reduces the supply of money in the economy, which helps manage the fed funds rate.</p>
<h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>Although one could dig further into the details of open market operations and the federal reserve system, hopefully this post clarifies the essential pieces of information needed to understand monetary policy at the Fed.  What has been described in this post is why rate hikes hit the front page of the Wall Street Journal and cause all sorts of political drama.  In the end, the fed funds rate affects the interbank lending market, which affects the price a bank charges for their financial products, which ultimately affects the end consumer.  The rate you get on a new mortgage is entirely influenced by the fed funds rate.  The rate you are paid on your savings account is influenced by the fed funds rate.  The rate you pay on your credit card is influenced by the fed funds rate.  In other words, your day to day spending decisions are influenced by the fed funds rate, and therefore, it is important to understand what it is all about.</p>
