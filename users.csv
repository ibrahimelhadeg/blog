Firstly my swing was so awful before but now I am getting into pretty good positions on p1, 2,3, but have a tendancy to throw the club over the tip coming down. Working on that but it is such a change I'm finding it a little difficult. Knowing what I am doing, by watching it, and seeing the various positions of the swing has been revelatory for me though as I would have practised a lot, watched a youtubr video and generally drive my sled mad not knowing what I was supposed to be doing!
