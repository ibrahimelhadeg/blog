This short crash course should be paired with the YouTube video below.  I recommend watching the video and using this post as a reference guide.

## Who is this course for?

This course has zero prerequisites.  I have designed it for the complete beginner and although you will not be fluent in C, Java, Javascript or Python (etc.) by the end of it, you will have a roadmap to guide you for months, or even years to come.  The goal of this tutorial is not to make you proficient in any one area but to expose you to many of the things you will see as you progress as a programmer.  With that in mind, this tutorial is also not going to be a massive resource list.  I know there are plenty of resources to learn how to code out there, and honestly, there are plenty of _awesome_ resources.  Learning to code is not a matter of finding the good stuff but rather being selective and disciplined to know when enough is enough.  This tutorial will provide tools and resources, but not so many that you feel overwhelmed.<span class="tooltip"><i class="fa fa-question-circle tooltip-icon"></i><span class="tooltip-text display-none">I guess it does not work<i class="fa fa-window-close close-it"></i></span></span>

## Github Repository

Although I would assume many viewers of this tutorial are not familiar with Github, I have included a repository to provide accompanying resources and to introduce you to "git" which is something you will use for the rest of your coding life.
