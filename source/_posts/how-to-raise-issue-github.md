Coding videos can be extremely helpful, but as the creator of them, I do not have the bandwith to constantly monitor the comments section and constantly update the videos as coding frameworks and languages change their specifications.  Usually, a framework will change the name of a function that they use, change the name of an import, or something of the sort, which causes the commands displayed in my videos to not work.  The videos themselves take hours to upload, and therefore re-uploading them for these little changes is not practical for me.

The better way to manage these types of issues is on the Github repository associated with the particular video you are watching.  Please follow these steps so I can get your questions resolved in the most efficient way possible: 

1. Go to the Github repository that your video has listed in the description, or at the top of the post.
2. Click on the Issues tab.

3. Once on the issues tab, click "New Issue"
4. Follow the template that is setup for each issue and make sure to [write your issue in Markdown!](https://gist.github.com/budparr/9257428)

I will always try to get back to you as soon as possible!
