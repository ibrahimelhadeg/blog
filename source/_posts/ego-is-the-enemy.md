Ego is the Enemy is a collection of stories from the history books on how a man’s “Ego” can destroy him in times of aspiration, success, and failure.  The book goes into many historical stories about how “Ego” can manifest itself in various environments and situations, and gives instruction on how to circumvent damaging ways of thinking.  I believe the main idea of the book circles around managing your career and learning to “suck it up, do the work, and resist the need to take all the credit”, but many ideas can be applied in all walks of life.

In such an idealistic time where everyone can start a “business”, and everyone can live the life of their dreams following their “passion", I think Ego is the Enemy is a great reminder for all of us.  It explores why “passions” can kill you, and why the work that one does should be the end goal rather than fame and recognition.  It is a sobering read that tells it how it is rather than sugarcoating reality.  The book is a quick read that will take you through the rise and fall of iconic figures while also detailing the simple ways of those “forgotten” figures who minded their own business and produced high quality work.
