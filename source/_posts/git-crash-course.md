## Prerequisites

This course is for anyone who is [familiar with the command line](https://zachgoll.github.io/blog/2019/bash-essentials) and needs to know all the essential commands for the Git utility.  You will need to have the following knowledge:

* Basic understanding of coding languages (we will not write any code, but will be looking at some)
* Basic mastery of the command line
* Basic understanding of open source software

## Topics

* Why use Git?
* Installation, and adding your credentials to Git
* Why use Git as a Single developer?
* Single developer Git workflow
* Why use Git on a team?
* Team Git workflow
* The differences between Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Local
* Common Git Problems and Solutions

## Why Use Git?

Git is a widely accepted, open source, local source control tool that enables single developers or teams manage their source code in a decentralized way.  I devoted an entire section to this question, but truthfully, you won't see the true power of this tool until we start using it.
