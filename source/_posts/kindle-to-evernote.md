For those who read a lot with Kindle and who take notes with Evernote, you know there isn't a good solution for copying the Kindle notes.  In the past, I have navigated to [https://read.amazon.com/notebook](https://read.amazon.com/notebook) and copy/pasted the notes into the note I am writing the Book review in.  Although this gets the job done, I was dissatisfied with the formatting.  When you copy/paste directly into Evernote, the notes look like they are bunched together in one big mess.

To solve this, I coded a simple [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kindle-highlights-to-ever/dbdbaefhojjpapcnpjmimnicdideclpd) that allows you to copy Kindle highlights and notes and paste them into Evernote with a clean formatting.

*Note*: If you paste into a note that already has text in it, make sure that you paste on a new line to avoid inheriting the existing formatting.
