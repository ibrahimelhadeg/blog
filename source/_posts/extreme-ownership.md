Extreme Ownership is the field manual for leadership and teamwork.  Although the goal of the authors is to describe leadership principles and how they apply to not only the battlefield but also life and business, I found that the pages revealed a more subtle characteristic of the Navy SEALs.  Throughout the book, I found myself absorbing the world class teamwork that the SEALs display on a day-to-day basis.  In companies and in life it is easy to adopt the “us vs. them” mentality where other departments of the company are “not my problem”, but this book explains how destructive such an attitude can be for yourself and your company.  It reminds the reader how powerful and productive teams can be if they  are unified.  Despite this, working well as a team, and for that matter, leading a team is far more difficult than one could write on paper.  This book is not some manifesto on leadership principles.  Although there are several “principles” introduced throughout each chapter, it should be read on an as-needed basis to inspire ideas about leadership.  Leadership is not a black and white task and therefore a book cannot cover the various scenarios that may arise.  This book acknowledges that fact and has been written in a way that inspires the reader to translate the anecdotes from Iraq to their own situations.

It is a thrilling read for anyone but a must read for leaders or soon to be leaders.

The one criticism that I have towards this book is the lack of detail provided in some of the anecdotes.  I do recognize that the authors did not want this book to be "another SEAL war hero story" (as they mention in the beginning), but to the average citizen, some of those stories allow me to understand the tragedies of war and the raw emotion that one faces while at war.  I thought that adding more detail would have allowed their leadership lessons to shine through just a little bit more effectively.
