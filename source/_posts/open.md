Open is one of those memoirs that draws you in and doesn't let you get up until the book is over.  Andre Agassi, despite being one of the greatest tennis players to ever live, hated the game.  He hated his childhood, hated playing tournaments, and most strikingly, hated himself.  The book is a wonderful journey through Agassi's life and shows a young, confused, angry kid transform into a man with a purpose.

As a collegiate golfer myself who often despised the early morning tee times, this story hit the nail on the head in describing some of the unglamorous aspects of playing a sport competitively.  The common perception of competitive athletes is prestige and celebrity status but in reality, it is no more than long days of travel, difficult relationships, and a neverending pressure to win "just one more time".

Agassi describes the acute pain that comes from not having a choice in life.  His father forced him to become a professional tennis player, which as one might guess, had a major impact on Agassi's outlook on life.  Growing up and well into his 20s, Agassi describes how lost, confused, and unhappy he felt as a result of his father's dreams for him to be number one in the world:

"After years of hearing my father rant at my flaws, one loss has caused me to take up his rant.  I've internalized my father--his impatience, his perfectionism, his rage--until his voice doesn't feel like my own, it is my own.  I no longer need my father to torture me.  From this day on, I can do it all by myself."

This book is not all gloomy though--it documents the transformation that Agassi makes through his life.  Agassi takes the reader through the many lessons he learned in his rough early days.  He tells how fulfilling it was to start the Andre Agassi Preparatory Academy, get married, have kids, and finally play for something other than himself.  The reader gets to see the transformation of an athlete who once walked onto the court scared to death of losing to an athlete who learned to play for something bigger.

A top 5 memoir in my book, and a must-read for anyone who has played a competitive sport in their lives.
