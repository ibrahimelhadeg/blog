Before digging into the book itself, it is important to recognize the work of John C. Bogle in the financial services industry.  As briefly highlighted in the book, Bogle started the Vanguard investment fund to test a thesis put out by a prominent researcher on the merits of "indexing".  He created the fund on the idea that investors shouldn't have to pay exorbitant management fees or transaction fees when putting their money away in a fund.  The work he has done cannot be matched, and the 500+ pages of this book prove it page after page.

That said, I cannot give this book a 5 star rating because in my eyes, it spends far too long discussing a far too simple premise.  The premise is straightforward and can be gleamed from the first few pages of reading.

"On average, investors would be better off to invest in an large cap index fund like the S&P 500 for the long term than any other investment strategy". 

If you are convinced of this line of reasoning already, this book may not be worth reading cover to cover.  Bogle does state near the beginning of the book, "My goal has been to make each chapter a freestanding and indepedent essay on a particular issue".  In my opinion, this book is an essential "manual" for personal investment strategy, but does not suffice for a casual weekend read.  The text ruminates on the topic of mutual funds to the point where the read feels like the logical arguments are going in circles.  Bogle does argue his points well though and backs them up with large amounts of historical data while also injecting his personal wisdom every so often (the true gem of the book).

As a millenial who has taken the personal computer revolution for granted, it is tough to appreciate the weight of this book.  U.S. mutual funds now hold over $2.5 T of U.S. equity securities compared to the $40 B in 1982, and even more startling, the concept of "indexing" is actually a novel idea still.  It was hard for me to grasp the innovation of indexing because I have always found it to be an obvious idea.  We have fast computers and lots of stock data, so why not index?

Although my demographic (23 years of age) was probably a primary target of this text, I feel that it did not accomplish the task of compelling my thinking enough to read it straight through.  Definitely worth a purchase, but I plan to peruse the chapters in random order as I need them rather than sit down and read the book cover to cover.
