Rating: 4/5 stars 

The Millionaire Next Door is required reading for anyone hoping to understand the unglamorous secret to wealth.  The book is a highly statistical exploration of America’s “millionaires”, which consists of households who have a net-worth of $1-10 MM.  The book focuses mainly on this cohort of people because they represent 95% of the millionaire population.  I personally found the book a bit of a slow read due to the heavy amount of statistics presented in a rather dry manner, but the information was well organized and the insights the reader gains is invaluable.  

The book highlights the “image” of an American millionaire and presents characteristics of this person in the form of what kind of cars they drive, how much time they spend planning their finances, how they allocate their wealth to their children and family, how their children generally grow up, and many more.  The book gives statistics such as “Over 50% of millionaires have never spent over $30,000 on a vehicle in their lives”, or “Of a select sample, 81% of millionaires bought their cars, while 19% leased.”.

Finally, the book presents a ratio to determine whether someone is an “Under Accumulator of Wealth” (UAW), or “Prodigious Accumulator of Wealth” (PAW), and how one can find themselves in the latter category through daily habits.  Overall, the book does not have much actionable advice, but presents information in a way that the reader may be able to assimilate many millionaire habits through a form of osmosis.  I am giving it 4 stars solely because the book was not a “quick read” and I thought it could have been presented with a little more creativity.
