## Teams Involved in this 

Given the fact that we will be developing the app start to finish without hiring any contractors, it begs the question whether a project plan is even necessary.  Why plan when you can just get started and figure it out along the way?

Although there is no funding and no contractors to hire for this project, we still need a project plan.  Not only will it help simulate what a real project might look like, but it will also allow us to narrow the scope of the code we have to write.  Essentially, we will play the roles of _client, project manager, and developer_.

## Choosing a Project Management Method

Sure, there are plenty of methods to choose from, but in industry, companies will generally choose between two: 

1. Waterfall Approach
2. Agile Approach (continuous delivery)

At the time of writing, the waterfall approach carries a negative stigma in PM (project manager) circles because can you really get the planning and budget right for a 3 year project anyways?  What's the point of a waterfall approach if the project changes so much along the way that the original plan is deemed useless?

I won't argue that the waterfall approach is better because in terms of efficiency, it's usually not.  That said, when working on a project for a client, that client is going to want to know a rough estimate of how long the project will take and for what cost.  You cannot just walk up to a client and say "We don't know how much this will cost, and we don't know how long it will take.  But we'll try our best?".

Likewise, it would be hard for you as the reader/viewer of this series if I had no structure behind the project.  Therefore, we must use a Waterfall Approach for this project and lay out a reasonable estimate of time and scope.

## Phase 1: Ideation (discovery), Cost Estimates, Proposal

The ideation has already happened, although in many cases the ideation phase can take weeks depending on the size of the project.  In our case, we are developing a small application that does not intend to extract large profits, so the ideation phase can be a quick analysis of whether it is worth the time.

A project like this could cost around $20K-$30K depending on some of the features you are looking for (based on a price estimate from [Estimate My App](https://estimatemyapp.com/)).  Since I am developing it for myself, there is no concept of a client, and no cost estimations to make.  Nevertheless, we will go through some of the considerations I would make had I decided to hire a team to build this.

**Most of the costs are personnel**.  The software itself does not cost much (unless you are a large corporation signing ELAs, SLAs, etc.).  As we will see, you can build a production web app with almost 100% open source (free) software.  The only _non-personnel_ cost we will incur across this project will be hosting costs and domain name costs (i.e. ongoing support costs).  

To grasp just how expensive the labor for a software project can get, consider a project that will take 10 weeks.  If you have a team of **5** developers working at **$65 per hour** (that's even on the low end) every day of the week, you'll end up paying around **$130K** for the project.

10 weeks x 40 hours / week x 5 contractors = 2,000 hours

2,000 hours x $65 per hour = $130,000 total cost

Didn't someone say open source software was completely free?...

In reality, cost estimates are more complex and involve multiple meetings with the client to discover what their product needs are, what their budget is, how fast they need the project completed, and other factors.  Through the course of the project, the client could also request additional features which will result in a request for funding.  If the client is not knowledgeable about software in general, the cost estimation process can turn out to be quite difficult and fall in the hands of the project manager (software company) to guide the client to a cost estimate.  Since our goal is to _write_ software and not _manage a project_, we will not dive too deep into the world of cost estimations.

A cost estimate is helpful, but in order to start the project, we need a Statement of Work (SoW) and approval of funding.  The SoW can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.  The ultimate goal with an SoW is to _protect yourself_ as a contractor against the client.  As the software company offering your development services, if there is any items that may become points of contention in the future, **put them in the SoW**.

Lucky for me, I am my own client, and although I have been known to be my own worst critic at times, it does not warrant an entire SoW.  That said, writing an SoW can be a good step to take 

### Proposal and Statement of Work
### Design Document

## Phase 4: Development/Delivery

This phase will consume the majority of our time since it is the ultimate focus of this series.  See part 3 for an introduction to development/delivery.

## Phase 5: Review and Support

The review and support phase is aimed to review the project, see what went right, and learn from what went wrong.  It also may include some ongoing support and/or transition measures to make sure that whoever is taking over the support for the application knows what they need to do. Oftentimes, the developers of a project will work with the support group to make sure a smooth transition is achieved.
