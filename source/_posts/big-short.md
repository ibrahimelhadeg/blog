This book was the basis for the Academy Award Winning film, _The Big Short_, which featured actors Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt and others.  I watched the film prior to reading the book, and was surprised to find that watching the film prior to reading the book made it all the more exciting.  With any cataclysmic public phenomenon, the characters in the heat of the battle are always at the heart of the story.  While reading this book, I felt as if I was re-watching the movie while getting all of my unanswered questions answered at the same time.

Prior to reading this book, I had read Michael Lewis's _Liars Poker_.  I found that this book, although not technically a "sequel", continued the story told by Lewis in his first book years ago.  Liars Poker tells the story of Salomon Brothers and the creation of the mortgage bond market, while The Big Short explains how those nascent years eventually led to the unraveling of the U.S. Economy.  Throughout the book, Lewis tells the story of the 2008 recession from the eyes of four different "short sellers" who were betting against the market.  This includes Michael Burry, Steve Eisman, the duo who named themselves "Cornwall Capital", and the unlikely Deutsche Bank trader Greg Lippman who was forced to short the market and turned it into personal profits exceeding $48MM.  All four of these short sellers took slightly different bets on the housing market from 2005-2008 when the market finally collapsed.

This is one of those books that you just cannot put down because the insanity that ensues between the pages is almost unfathomable.  It reads like a fantasy novel and you have to remind yourself over and over again that the series of events noted throughout the book _actually_ happened.  There were actually lenders who gave Mexican Apple Farmer's a loan on a $750K home despite the fact that this borrower would never be able to repay.  There were actually people within the ratings agencies who slapped AAA ratings on a package of mortgage bonds that they truly did not understand.  There were actually bankers who sold nearly half a trillion dollars of Credit Default Swaps on CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) without hedging their risk even one penny (hint: AIG).  

Not only is this book worth the read for pure entertainment, but also seems like an obligation of anyone working in the financial services industry.  Five out of five stars.
