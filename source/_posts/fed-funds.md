If you type in "fed funds rate" into Google, the top result is an Investopedia article describing what the fed funds rate means.  Although the article generally explains what this esoteric term really means, the reader is left grappling with the meanings of terms used throughout the article such as "FOMC", "prime lending rate", "open market operations", "reserve ratio", "contractionary monetary policy", "money supply", and many more.  Furthermore, what does it mean when the Wall Street Journal puts a headline on the front page that says ["Fed Raises Interest Rates, Signals One More Increase This Year"](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-raises-interest-rates-signals-one-more-increase-this-year-1537984955)?  After reading that front page article, you're left wondering what the "yield curve" is, what "interbank lending" means, and why all these economists are so hyped up about such a dry and boring subject.  To make matters even more frustrating, the entire world of finance talks about this subject as if it were basic Algebra and everyone should easily understand it.  Although the basic premise of the fed funds rate may be simple, it touches on a slew of topics that ultimately govern how we as consumers live our daily lives.
