In this post, I will explore two simple questions from the lens of Banking.

1. What is the yield curve?
2. Why is it helpful?

## Notes - Why helpful

* Sets yield on debt market securities at different maturities
* Indicator of future yield levels
* Comparing returns across maturity spectrum
* Relative value of bonds of similar maturity
* Price interest rate derivatives

### Zero Coupon vs. Redemption Yield Curves

Spot yield for specific term = ytm on zero coupon bond of term
Spot yield 10 year bond = ytm on zero coupon of 10 year
YTM is rate if bond is held to maturity
Spot rate is rate if bond is sold now
